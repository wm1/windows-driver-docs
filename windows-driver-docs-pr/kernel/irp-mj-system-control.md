# IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL


All drivers must provide a [*DispatchSystemControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543412) routine that handles **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests, which are sent by the kernel-mode component of [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547139) (WMI).

When Sent
---------

The WMI kernel-mode component can send an **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** request any time following a driver's successful registration as a supplier of WMI data. WMI IRPs typically are sent when a user-mode data consumer has requested WMI data.

## Input Parameters


Depends on the value at **MinorFunction** in the current I/O stack location of the IRP. Every **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** request specifies a minor function code that identifies the requested WMI action.

## Output Parameters


Depends on the value at **MinorFunction** in the current I/O stack location of the IRP.

Operation
---------

All drivers must support **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests by supplying a [*DispatchSystemControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543412) routine.

Drivers that support [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547139) (WMI) must handle **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests by processing the minor function codes associated with this major function code. For information about the WMI minor function codes, see [WMI Minor IRPs](wmi-minor-irps.md).

Drivers that do not support WMI by [registering as a WMI data provider](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560870) must pass **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests to the next lower driver.

# Receiving a Wait/Wake IRP


## <a href="" id="ddk-receiving-a-wait-wake-irp-kg"></a>


All PnP drivers must be prepared to receive power IRPs with minor IRP code [**IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551766). How a driver handles a wait/wake IRP depends on its position in the device stack, the type of device(s) it controls, and the specific states from which its device supports wake-up.

The topics in this section provide guidelines for handling this IRP based on the type of driver and its level of wait/wake support.

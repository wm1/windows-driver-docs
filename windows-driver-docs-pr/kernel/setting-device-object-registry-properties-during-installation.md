# Setting Device Object Registry Properties During Installation


## <a href="" id="ddk-setting-device-object-registry-properties-during-installation-kg"></a>


To set device object properties during installation, you must provide an INF file that specifies the properties. You can specify device object properties for either a device, or a device setup class.

These are specified as follows.

-   For an individual device, properties are set in the *add-registry-section* for the device. The INF **AddReg** directive within the device's *DDInstall*.HW section specifies the *add-registry-section* for the device.

-   For a device setup class, properties are set in the *add-registry-section* for the device setup class. The INF **AddReg** directive within the **ClassInstall32** section for the class specifies the *add-registry-section* for the class.

Within an *add-registry-section*, the following keywords can be used to specify the individual device object property to set.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Device object property</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>DeviceType</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Device type</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>DeviceCharacteristics</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Device characteristics</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Exclusive</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Exclusive</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Security</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Security descriptor</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

For more information about using these keywords, see [**INF AddReg Directive**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546320).

The settings can be set by a user-mode component by using the device installation functions. For more information, see [Setting Device Object Registry Properties After Installation](setting-device-object-registry-properties-after-installation.md).

# Calling PoStartNextPowerIrp from a Bus Driver


## <a href="" id="ddk-calling-postartnextpowerirp-from-a-bus-driver-kg"></a>


Beginning with Windows Vista, calling [**PoStartNextPowerIrp**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559776) is not required and call to this routine performs no power management operation. However, in Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000, a bus driver must call **PoStartNextPowerIrp** once for every [**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551699) or [**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744) request that the driver receives.

A bus driver always calls this routine in its *DispatchPower* routine, before it calls the [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) routine.

# Designing WMI Data and Event Blocks


## <a href="" id="ddk-designing-wmi-data-and-event-blocks-kg"></a>


For best performance and ease of use by WMI clients, a driver should support standard data blocks, and driver writers should follow certain guidelines in designing custom WMI data and event blocks. In particular, driver writers should be aware of performance tradeoffs in choosing static versus dynamic instance names for data blocks. The topics in this section discuss issues and guidelines for designing WMI data and event blocks.

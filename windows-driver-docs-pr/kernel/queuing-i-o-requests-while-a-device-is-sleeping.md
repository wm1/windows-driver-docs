# Queuing I/O Requests While a Device Is Sleeping


## <a href="" id="ddk-queuing-i-o-requests-while-a-device-is-sleeping-kg"></a>


While a device is asleep, its drivers should queue any I/O requests directed to the device. The [**IoAllocateWorkItem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548276), [**IoQueueWorkItem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549466), and [**IoFreeWorkItem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549133) support routines provide one way of queuing IRPs for delayed processing. For an example, see the queuing mechanism described for PnP drivers in [Holding Incoming IRPs When A Device Is Paused](holding-incoming-irps-when-a-device-is-paused.md).

A driver can access its device only when the device is in the Working (D0) state. A driver cannot touch any device registers when the device is in a sleep state; the device must first be returned to the Working state.

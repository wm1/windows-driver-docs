# Using NTSTATUS Values


## <a href="" id="ddk-using-ntstatus-values-kg"></a>


Many kernel-mode [standard driver routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563842) and [driver support routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563889) use the NTSTATUS type for return values. Additionally, drivers provide an NTSTATUS-typed value in an IRP's [**IO\_STATUS\_BLOCK**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550671) structure when [completing IRPs](completing-irps.md). The NTSTATUS type is defined in Ntdef.h, and system-supplied status codes are defined in Ntstatus.h. (Vendors can also define private status codes, although they rarely need to. For more information, see [Defining New NTSTATUS Values](defining-new-ntstatus-values.md).)

NTSTATUS values are divided into four types: success values, informational values, warnings, and error values.

Numerous values are assigned to each type. A common mistake, when testing for a successful return from a routine, is to compare the routine's return value with STATUS\_SUCCESS. This comparison checks for only one of several success values.

When testing a return value, you should use one of the following system-supplied macros (defined in Ntdef.h):

<a href="" id="nt-success-status-"></a>NT\_SUCCESS(*Status*)  
Evaluates to **TRUE** if the return value specified by *Status* is a success type (0 − 0x3FFFFFFF) or an informational type (0x40000000 − 0x7FFFFFFF).

<a href="" id="nt-information-status-"></a>NT\_INFORMATION(*Status*)  
Evaluates to **TRUE** if the return value specified by *Status* is an informational type (0x40000000 − 0x7FFFFFFF).

<a href="" id="nt-warning-status-"></a>NT\_WARNING(*Status*)  
Evaluates to **TRUE** if the return value specified by *Status* is a warning type (0x80000000 − 0xBFFFFFFF).

<a href="" id="nt-error-status-"></a>NT\_ERROR(*Status*)  
Evaluates to **TRUE** if the return value specified by *Status* is an error type (0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF).

For example, suppose a driver calls [**IoRegisterDeviceInterface**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549506) to register a device interface. If the driver checks the return value using the NT\_SUCCESS macro, the macro will evaluate to **TRUE** if the routine returns STATUS\_SUCCESS, which indicates no errors, or if it returns the informational status STATUS\_OBJECT\_NAME\_EXISTS, which indicates that the device interface is already registered.

As another example, suppose a driver calls [**ZwEnumerateKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566447) to enumerate the subkeys of a specified registry key. If the NT\_SUCCESS macro evaluates to **FALSE**, it might be because the routine returned STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER, which is an error code, or because the routine returned STATUS\_NO\_MORE\_ENTRIES, which is a warning code.

As a final example, suppose a driver sends an IRP that causes a lower-level driver to read information from a device. If the requesting driver specifies a buffer that is too small to receive any information, the lower-level driver might respond by returning STATUS\_BUFFER\_TOO\_SMALL, which is an error code. If the first driver specifies a buffer that can receive some, but not all, of the requested information, the lower-level driver might respond by supplying as much data as possible and then returning STATUS\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW, which is a warning code. Note that if the first driver tests the status value using NT\_SUCCESS or NT\_ERROR incorrectly, it might inadvertently drop some of the information received.

# Handling a System Set-Power IRP in a Bus Driver


## <a href="" id="ddk-handling-a-system-set-power-irp-in-a-bus-driver-kg"></a>


When a bus driver receives a system set-power IRP, it must take the following steps:

1.  Call [**PoStartNextPowerIrp**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559776) to start the next power IRP. (Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 only.)

2.  Set **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS. The driver cannot fail a system set-power IRP.

3.  Call [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343), specifying IO\_NO\_INCREMENT, to complete the IRP.

The bus driver does not change device power settings until it receives a power IRP that requests a device power state.

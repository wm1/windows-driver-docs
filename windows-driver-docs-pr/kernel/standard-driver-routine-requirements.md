# Standard Driver Routine Requirements


## <a href="" id="ddk-standard-driver-routine-requirements-kg"></a>


Keep the following points in mind when designing a kernel-mode driver:

-   Each driver must have a [**DriverEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544113) routine, which initializes driver-wide data structures and resources. The I/O manager calls the **DriverEntry** routine when it loads the driver.

-   Every driver must have at least one dispatch routine that receives and processes I/O request packets (IRPs). Each driver must place a dispatch routine's entry point in its [**DRIVER\_OBJECT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544174) structure, for each [IRP major function code](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550710) that the driver can receive. A driver can have a separate dispatch routine for each IRP major function code, or it can have one or more dispatch routines that handle several function codes.

-   Every WDM driver must have an [*Unload*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564886) routine. The driver must place the *Unload* routine's entry point in the driver's driver object. The responsibilities of a [PnP driver's Unload routine](pnp-driver-s-unload-routine.md) are minimal, but a [non-PnP driver's unload routine](non-pnp-driver-s-unload-routine.md) is responsible for releasing any system resources that the driver is using.

-   Every WDM driver must have an [*AddDevice*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521) routine and define its entry point in the [*driver extension*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-driver-extension) of the driver object. An *AddDevice* routine is responsible for creating and initializing device objects for each PnP device the driver controls.

-   A driver can have a [*StartIo*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858) routine, which the I/O manager calls to start I/O operations for IRPs the driver has queued to a system-supplied IRP queue. Any driver that does not have a *StartIo* routine must either set up and manage internal queues for the IRPs it receives, or it must complete every IRP within its dispatch routines. Higher-level drivers might not have a *StartIo* routine, if they simply pass IRPs to lower-level drivers directly from their dispatch routines.

-   Certain miniport drivers are exceptions to the preceding requirements. See the device-type-specific documentation in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for information about the requirements for miniport drivers.

-   Whether a driver has any other kind of standard routine depends on its functionality and on how that driver fits into the system (for example, whether it interoperates with system-supplied drivers). See the device-type specific documentation in the WDK for details.

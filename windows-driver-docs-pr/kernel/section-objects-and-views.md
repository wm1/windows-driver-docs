# Section Objects and Views


## <a href="" id="ddk-section-objects-and-views-kg"></a>


A *section object* represents a section of memory that can be shared. A process can use a section object to share parts of its memory address space (memory sections) with other processes. Section objects also provide the mechanism by which a process can map a file into its memory address space.

Each memory section has one or more corresponding *views*. A view of a section is a part of the section that is actually visible to a process. The act of creating a view for a section is known as *mapping* a view of the section. Each process that is manipulating the contents of a section has its own view; a process can also have multiple views (to the same or different sections).

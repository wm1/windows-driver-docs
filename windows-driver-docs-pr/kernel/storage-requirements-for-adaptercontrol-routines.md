# Storage Requirements for AdapterControl Routines


## <a href="" id="ddk-storage-requirements-for-adaptercontrol-routines-kg"></a>


If it has an [*AdapterControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540504) routine, a driver must provide resident storage for the following:

-   Context information to be used in its DMA operations

-   An adapter object pointer returned by [**IoGetDmaAdapter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220)

-   A ULONG-type variable to hold the system-determined maximum *NumberOfMapRegisters* available for any given DMA transfer request

The driver can provide the necessary storage in a device extension, in a controller extension, or in nonpaged pool allocated by the driver.

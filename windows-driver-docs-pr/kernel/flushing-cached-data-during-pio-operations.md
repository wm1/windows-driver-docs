# Flushing Cached Data during PIO Operations


## <a href="" id="ddk-flushing-cached-data-during-pio-operations-kg"></a>


On some platforms, the instruction and data caches in the processor exhibit cache coherency anomalies during PIO read operations.

**Note**   To maintain data integrity during their read operations, drivers that use PIO must follow this guideline:
Call [**KeFlushIoBuffers**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552041) at the end of each read operation.

For example, a driver making a PIO transfer from its device to system memory should call **KeFlushIoBuffers** at the end of each device transfer operation. As another example, a driver that reads a sequence of device registers into system memory should call **KeFlushIoBuffers** at the end of the sequence. Otherwise, such a driver might attempt to access data that is still in the processor's data cache, rather than in system memory, on some platforms.

 

**KeFlushIoBuffers** does nothing if the processor can be relied on to maintain cache coherency, so calls to this support routine have almost no overhead in such a platform.

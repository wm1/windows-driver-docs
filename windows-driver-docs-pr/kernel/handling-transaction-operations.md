# Handling Transaction Operations


Resource managers must handle three transaction operations: *commit*, *rollback*, and *recovery*.

To *commit a transaction*, a resource manager makes all changes to a transaction's data permanent and visible to other transactions.

To *roll back a transaction*, a resource manager removes all changes to a transaction's data. The resource manager must restore the data to the state that it was in before the transaction was created.

To *recover a transaction*, a resource manager restores a transaction's data to a known good state after a system crash or another unexpected event.

This section contains the following topics:

[Handling Commit Operations](handling-commit-operations.md)

[Handling Rollback Operations](handling-rollback-operations.md)

[Handling Recovery Operations](handling-recovery-operations.md)

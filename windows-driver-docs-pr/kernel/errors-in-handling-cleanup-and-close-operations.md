# Errors in Handling Cleanup and Close Operations


## <a href="" id="ddk-errors-in-handling-cleanup-and-close-operations-kg"></a>


Some drivers fail to distinguish the tasks required in [*DispatchCleanup*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543233) and [*DispatchClose*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543255) routines. The I/O manager calls a driver's *DispatchCleanup* routine when the last handle to a file object is closed. The *DispatchClose* routine is called when the last reference is released from the file object. A driver should not attempt to free resources in its *DispatchCleanup* routine that are attached to a file object or might be used by other *Dispatch*Xxx routines.

When calling dispatch routines, the I/O manager holds a reference to the file object for normal I/O calls. As a result, a driver can receive I/O requests for a file object after its *DispatchCleanup* routine has been called but before its *DispatchClose* routine is called. For example, a user-mode caller might close the file handle while an I/O manager request is in progress from another thread. If the driver has deleted or freed necessary resources before the I/O manager calls its *DispatchClose* routine, invalid pointer references and other problems could occur.

# Writing a StartIo Routine


## <a href="" id="ddk-writing-a-startio-routine-kg"></a>


As its name suggests, a [*StartIo*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858) routine is responsible for starting an I/O operation on the physical device.

Most lowest-level drivers provide a *StartIo* routine and rely on the I/O manager to queue IRPs to a system-supplied device queue. Some lowest-level drivers are designed to set up and manage their own supplemental IRP queues, but even these usually also provide a *StartIo* routine. (For more information about supplemental queues, see [Setting up and Using Device Queues](setting-up-and-using-device-queues.md) and [Managing Device Queues](managing-device-queues.md).)

Higher-level drivers, including FSDs and PnP function and filter drivers, seldom have a *StartIo* routine because it can hamper performance. Instead, most file system drivers set up and maintain internal queues of IRPs. Other higher-level drivers either have internal queues for IRPs or simply pass IRPs on to lower drivers from their dispatch routines. See [Driver-Managed IRP Queues](driver-managed-irp-queues.md) for more information.

You can use the [**IoSetStartIoAttributes**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550330) routine to set attributes that modify *StartIo* handling for your driver.

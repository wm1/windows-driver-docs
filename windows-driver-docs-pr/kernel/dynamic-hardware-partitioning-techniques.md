# Dynamic Hardware Partitioning Techniques


Changing the hardware configuration of a server while the server is running is known as *dynamic hardware partitioning*. If you want to run your device drivers on servers that support dynamic hardware partitioning, your drivers must support dynamic changes to the hardware configuration of the server.

This section includes the following topics:

[Introduction to Dynamic Hardware Partitioning](introduction-to-dynamic-hardware-partitioning.md)

[Dynamic Hardware Partitioning Architecture](dynamic-hardware-partitioning-architecture.md)

[Critical Issues for Device Drivers](critical-issues-for-device-drivers.md)

[Driver Notification](driver-notification.md)

[Application Notification](application-notification.md)

# Writing ControllerControl Routines


## <a href="" id="ddk-writing-controllercontrol-routines-kg"></a>


Drivers that use a controller object must supply a [*ControllerControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542049) routine to initiate I/O operations.

A lowest-level device driver that must synchronize operations through a physical controller, such as an "AT" disk controller, to similar devices can have a *ControllerControl* routine.

When a driver calls [**IoAllocateController**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548224), its *ControllerControl* routine is run immediately if the hardware represented by the controller object is available for an I/O operation. Otherwise, the *ControllerControl* routine is queued until the controller is free.

**Note**  WDM drivers cannot use controller objects and *ControllerControl* routines.

# I/O Programming Techniques


## <a href="" id="ddk-input-output-techniques-kg"></a>


This section describes programming techniques that can be used to work with objects managed by the I/O manager. The following technology areas are discussed:

[General I/O Programming Techniques](general-i-o-programming-techniques.md)

[Methods for Accessing Data Buffers](methods-for-accessing-data-buffers.md)

[DMA Programming Techniques](dma-programming-techniques.md)

[PIO Programming Techniques](pio-techniques.md)

[Legacy I/O Programming](legacy-i-o-programming.md)

For architectural information on the I/O manager, see [Windows I/O Manager](windows-kernel-mode-i-o-manager.md). For reference information on I/O manager, see [I/O Manager Routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551797).

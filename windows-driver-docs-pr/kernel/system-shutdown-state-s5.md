# System Shutdown State S5


## <a href="" id="ddk-system-shutdown-state-s5-kg"></a>


In the S5, or shutdown, state, the machine has no memory state and is not performing any computational tasks.

The only difference between states S4 and S5 is that the computer can restart from the hibernate file in state S4, while restarting from state S5 requires rebooting the system.

State S5 has the following characteristics:

<a href="" id="power-consumption"></a>**Power consumption**  
Off, except for trickle current to devices such as the power button.

<a href="" id="software-resumption"></a>**Software resumption**  
Boot is required upon awakening.

<a href="" id="hardware-latency"></a>**Hardware latency**  
Long and undefined. Only physical interaction, such as the user pressing the ON switch, returns the system to the working state. The BIOS can also awaken from a resume timer if the system is so configured.

<a href="" id="system-hardware-context"></a>**System hardware context**  
None retained.

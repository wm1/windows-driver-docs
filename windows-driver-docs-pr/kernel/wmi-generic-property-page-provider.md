# WMI Generic Property Page Provider


## <a href="" id="ddk-wmi-generic-property-page-provider-kg"></a>


On Windows XP and later operating systems, drivers can expose their WMI classes through the WMI generic property page provider. The provider uses each class declaration to create a simple property page for the class properties.

### How Property Qualifiers Determine the Property Page

The WMI generic property page provider uses a control appropriate for the data type of each property in the class. The following property qualifiers modify the type of control used:

-   **Write**

    A property with the **write** qualifier can be changed through the property page. Otherwise the property is read-only.

-   **Values** and **ValuesMap**

    The generic property page provider uses a list box to represent the possible values.

-   **Range**

    The generic property page provider validates that the data entered conforms to the specified range.

-   **DisplayName**

    The generic property page provider uses the value of this property qualifier as the label for the property.

-   **DisplayInHex**

    If present, the property value is displayed in hexadecimal.

Driver writers should localize property qualifiers that are strings. See [Localizing MOF Files](localizing-mof-files.md) for details.

### Enabling the Generic Property Page Provider

Each device that exposes classes to be used by Wmiprop.dll must enable Wmiprop.dll as a co-installer. To do this, make the following addition to the co-installer *add-registry-section*: add a value entry for the class GUID under the **HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CoDeviceInstallers** registry key. The value for the value entry is "WmiProp.dll, WmiPropCoInstaller".

For example:

```
; This section is defined in the Co-installer section, as follows.
; [Co-installer]
; AddReg = CoInstaller_AddReg

[CoInstaller_AddReg] 
HKLM, System\CurrentControlSet\Control\CoDeviceInstallers, ClassGUID,
    0x00010000, "WmiProp.dll, WmiPropCoInstaller"
```

*ClassGUID* is the GUID for the WMI class. See [Registering a Class Co-installer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549801) for details.

You must also specify the particular WMI classes to be exposed through the generic property provider. To do this, set the **WmiConfigClasses** value-entry to be a comma-separated list of the WMI classes in the *add-registry-section* of the device class or device hardware instance.

```
; the device class AddReg section.
[device_class_AddReg]
HKR,,"WmiConfigClasses",0x00000000,"class1,class2"

; the device hardware instance AddReg section.
[device_hw_inst_AddReg]
HKR,,"WmiConfigClasses",0x00000000,"class3"
```

See [**INF AddReg Directive**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546320) for a description of an *add-registry-section* in INF files.

Wmiprop.dll assumes only one instance of each class. Each class is represented by a tab on the property sheet. Use the **DisplayName** property qualifier to set the title text of the tab. A property page for a class only appears if there is currently an instance of the class. Therefore, if the device is removed or not started, the pages do not appear.

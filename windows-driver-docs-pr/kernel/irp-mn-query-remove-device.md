# IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_REMOVE\_DEVICE


All PnP drivers must handle this IRP.

Major Code
----------

[**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md)
When Sent
---------

The PnP manager sends this IRP to inform drivers that a device is about to be removed from the computer and to query whether the device can be removed without disrupting the computer. The PnP manager also sends this IRP if a user requests to update driver(s) for the device.

The PnP manager sends this IRP at IRQL PASSIVE\_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## I/O Status Block


A driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status such as STATUS\_UNSUCCESSFUL.

Operation
---------

This IRP is handled first by the driver at the top of the device stack and then passed down to each lower driver in the stack.

In response to this IRP, drivers indicate whether the device can be removed without disrupting the computer.

For more information about handling this IRP, see [Handling an IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_REMOVE\_DEVICE Request](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546674). For general information about supporting device removal, see [Removing a Device](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561046).

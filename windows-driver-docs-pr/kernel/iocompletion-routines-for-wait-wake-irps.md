# IoCompletion Routines for Wait/Wake IRPs


## <a href="" id="ddk-iocompletion-routines-for-wait-wake-irps-kg"></a>


The I/O manager calls a driver's wait/wake [*IoCompletion*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548354) routine after the next-lower driver in the device stack has completed the wait/wake IRP. Each function and filter (FDO) driver that handles a wait/wake IRP should set an *IoCompletion* routine for the IRP.

Each function or filter driver sets an *IoCompletion* routine as it handles the wait/wake IRP on its way down the device stack. The device power policy owner, which sends the IRP, might therefore have an *IoCompletion* routine in addition to a callback routine. Keep in mind that the callback routine is invoked after the *IoCompletion* routine and that the two have different requirements. For more information, see [Wait/Wake Callback Routines](wait-wake-callback-routines.md).

The actions required in a wait/wake *IoCompletion* routine depend on the device and the type of driver. The following are some actions a driver might need to perform in its wait/wake *IoCompletion* routine:

1.  Reset any relevant fields in the device extension. For example, when a wait/wake IRP is pending, most drivers set a flag and keep a pointer to the IRP in the device extension.

2.  Reset the [*Cancel*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540742) routine, if any, for the IRP by calling [**IoSetCancelRoutine**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549674), specifying a **NULL** pointer for the routine.

3.  Call **IoCompleteRequest**, specifying IO\_NO\_INCREMENT, to complete the IRP.

As each successive driver completes the IRP, the I/O manager passes control to the *IoCompletion* routine of the next-higher driver going back up the stack.

After calling the *IoCompletion* routines set by drivers as they passed the wait/wake IRP down the device stack, the I/O manager calls the callback routine passed to [**PoRequestPowerIrp**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559734) by the driver that sent the IRP. For further information, see [Wait/Wake Callback Routines](wait-wake-callback-routines.md).

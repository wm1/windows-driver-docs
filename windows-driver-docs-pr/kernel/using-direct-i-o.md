# Using Direct I/O


## <a href="" id="ddk-using-direct-i-o-kg"></a>


Drivers for devices that can transfer large amounts of data at a time should use direct I/O for those transfers. Using direct I/O for large transfers improves a driver's performance, both by reducing its interrupt overhead and by eliminating the memory allocation and copying operations inherent in buffered I/O.

Generally, mass-storage device drivers request direct I/O for transfer requests, including lowest-level drivers that use direct memory access (DMA) or programmed I/O (PIO), as well as any intermediate drivers chained above them.

The I/O manager determines that an I/O operation is using direct I/O as follows:

-   For [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550794) and [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550819) requests, DO\_DIRECT\_IO is set in the **Flags** member of the [**DEVICE\_OBJECT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147) structure. For more information, see [Initializing a Device Object](initializing-a-device-object.md).

-   For [**IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550744) and [**IRP\_MJ\_INTERNAL\_DEVICE\_CONTROL**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550766) requests, the IOCTL code's value contains METHOD\_IN\_DIRECT or METHOD\_OUT\_DIRECT as the *TransferType* value in the IOCTL value. For more information, see [Defining I/O Control Codes](defining-i-o-control-codes.md).

Drivers that use direct I/O will sometimes also use buffered I/O to handle some IRPs. In particular, drivers typically use buffered I/O for some I/O control codes for **IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL** requests that require data transfers, regardless of whether the driver uses direct I/O for read and write operations.

Setting up a direct I/O transfer varies slightly, depending on whether DMA or PIO is being used. For more information, see:

[Using Direct I/O with DMA](using-direct-i-o-with-dma.md)

[Using Direct I/O with PIO](using-direct-i-o-with-pio.md)

Drivers must take steps to maintain cache coherency during DMA and PIO transfers. For more information, see [Maintaining Cache Coherency](maintaining-cache-coherency.md).

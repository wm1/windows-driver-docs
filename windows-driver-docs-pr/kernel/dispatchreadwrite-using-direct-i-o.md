# DispatchReadWrite Using Direct I/O


## <a href="" id="ddk-dispatchreadwrite-using-direct-i-o-kg"></a>


Any lower-level device driver that sets up its device objects for direct I/O satisfies a read request by returning data transferred from its device to system physical memory, which is described by the MDL at **Irp-&gt;MdlAddress**. It satisfies a write request by transferring data from system physical memory out to its device.

Lower-level drivers must handle read/write requests asynchronously. Therefore, every lower-level driver's [*DispatchReadWrite*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543381) routine must pass [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550794) and [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550819) IRPs with valid parameters on to other driver routines, as described in [Passing IRPs down the Driver Stack](passing-irps-down-the-driver-stack.md).

For read/write IRPs sent to lower-level drivers, the paged physical memory described by the MDL at **Irp-&gt;MdlAddress** has already been probed for the correct access rights to carry out the requested transfer and has already been locked down by the highest-level driver in the chain or by the I/O manager. Any intermediate or lowest-level driver that sets up its device objects for direct I/O should not call [**MmProbeAndLockPages**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554664) because this has already been done. A lowest-level driver calls [**MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554559). (Drivers for Windows 98 call [**MmGetSystemAddressForMdl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554556) instead. Drivers for Windows Me, Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows should use **MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe**.)

Any intermediate or lowest-level device driver's *DispatchReadWrite* routine should validate the parameters in its I/O stack location of read/write IRPs if it cannot trust a higher-level driver to pass down only IRPs with valid parameters. If the *DispatchReadWrite* routine finds a parameter error, it should complete the IRP with an appropriate error STATUS\_*XXX* value as already described in [Completing IRPs](completing-irps.md). If parameters are valid, an intermediate driver's *DispatchReadWrite* routine must pass the request on for further processing, according to the guidelines in [DispatchReadWrite in Higher-Level Drivers](dispatchreadwrite-in-higher-level-drivers.md).

A lowest-level device driver's *DispatchReadWrite* routine must call [**IoMarkIrpPending**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549422) with the transfer request, pass the IRP on for further processing by other driver routines, and return STATUS\_PENDING, as described in [Passing IRPs down the Driver Stack](passing-irps-down-the-driver-stack.md).

Note that a device driver's *DispatchReadWrite* routine can control the order in which IRPs are queued to its device for faster I/O throughput by calling [**IoStartPacket**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550370) with a driver-determined *Key* value. Another routine in the driver dequeues the IRP later, determines whether the requested length must be split into partial-transfer operations, and programs the device to transfer data.

In general, a device driver that must split up large transfer requests to suit the limitations of its device should postpone these operations until just before setting up the device for a given transfer request. Such a device driver's *DispatchReadWrite* routine should not check the I/O stack location of incoming IRPs for any device-specific transfer constraints, nor attempt to calculate partial-transfer ranges, when the driver can postpone these checks until just before its [*StartIo*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858) (or other driver routine) programs the device for a transfer operation.

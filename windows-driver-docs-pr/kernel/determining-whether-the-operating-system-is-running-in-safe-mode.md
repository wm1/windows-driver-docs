# Determining Whether the Operating System Is Running in Safe Mode


This topic describes how a device driver can determine whether the operating system that it is running on was started in Safe Mode. This topic also describes how to prevent a driver from operating in Safe Mode.

The Microsoft Windows operating system kernel exports a pointer named **InitSafeBootMode**. **InitSafeBootMode** points to a ULONG variable that contains the Safe Mode settings that are currently in effect. A device driver can examine these settings to determine whether the operating system is running in Safe Mode.

The following table lists the modes for values of the **InitSafeBootMode** variable.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Mode</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>0</p></td>
<td><p>The operating system is not in Safe Mode.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>SAFEBOOT_MINIMAL</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>2</p></td>
<td><p>SAFEBOOT_NETWORK</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>3*</p></td>
<td><p>SAFEBOOT_DSREPAIR</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

**Note**  \* The value 3 applies to Windows domain controllers only.

 

To use the **InitSafeBootMode** variable, you must declare it in your driver, as the following code example shows.

```
extern PULONG InitSafeBootMode;
```

After you declare **InitSafeBootMode**, you can use the following code example to determine whether the operating system is running in Safe Mode.

```
if (*InitSafeBootMode > 0) {
    // The operating system is in Safe Mode.
    // Take appropriate action.
    //
}
```

To prevent a driver from operating in Safe Mode, use the technique in the following list that matches your driver type:

-   **Function drivers**

    If your function driver has a service start type of SERVICE\_BOOT\_START, check the value of **InitSafeBootMode** in the function driver's *AddDevice* routine. If the system is in Safe Mode, return a failure status.

    **Note**   You must never return failure from the **DriverEntry** routine.

     

-   **Filter drivers**

    If your filter driver starts during system startup, check the value of **InitSafeBootMode** in the filter driver's *AddDevice* routine. If the operating system is in Safe Mode, do the following:

    1.  Do not attach the filter device object to the device stack.
    2.  Return success from the filter driver's *AddDevice* routine.
-   **Other drivers**

    For drivers other than function or filter drivers, check the value of **InitSafeBootMode** in the driver's **DriverEntry** routine. If the operating system is in Safe Mode, return a failure status.

# IRP\_MJ\_WRITE


Every device driver that transfers data from the system to its device must handle write requests in a [*DispatchWrite*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544034) or [*DispatchReadWrite*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543381) routine, as must any higher-level driver layered over such a device driver.

When Sent
---------

Any time following the successful completion of a create request.

Possibly, a user-mode application or Win32 component with a handle for the file object representing the target device object has requested a data transfer to the device. Possibly, a higher-level driver has created and set up the write IRP.

## Input Parameters


The driver's I/O stack location in the IRP indicates how many bytes to transfer at **Parameters.Write.Length**.

Some drivers use the value at **Parameters.Write.Key** to sort incoming write requests into a driver-determined order in the device queue or in a driver-managed internal queue of IRPs.

Certain types of drivers also use the value at **Parameters.Write.ByteOffset**, which indicates the starting offset for the transfer operation. For example, see the [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549427) topic in the Installable File System (IFS) documentation.

Depending on whether the underlying device driver sets up the target device object's **Flags** with DO\_BUFFERED\_IO or with DO\_DIRECT\_IO, data is transferred from one of the following:

-   The buffer at **Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**, if the driver uses buffered I/O

-   The buffer described by the MDL at **Irp-&gt;MdlAddress**, if the underlying device driver uses direct I/O (DMA or PIO)

## Output Parameters


None

Operation
---------

On receipt of a write request, a higher-level driver sets up the I/O stack location in the IRP for the next-lower driver, or it creates and sets up additional IRPs for one or more lower drivers. It can set up its [*IoCompletion*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548354) routine, which is optional for the input IRP but required for driver-created IRPs, by calling [**IoSetCompletionRoutine**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549679). Then, the driver passes the request on to the next-lower driver with [**IoCallDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548336).

On receipt of a write request, a device driver transfers data from system memory to its device. The device driver sets the **Information** field of the I/O status block to the number of bytes transferred when it completes the IRP.

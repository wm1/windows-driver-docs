# Passing PnP IRPs Down the Device Stack


## <a href="" id="ddk-passing-pnp-irps-down-the-device-stack-kg"></a>


The PnP manager uses IRPs to direct drivers to start, stop, and remove devices and to query drivers about their devices. All PnP IRPs have the major function code [**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550772), and all PnP drivers must provide a [*DispatchPnP*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543341) routine to service this function code. The PnP manager initializes **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED when it sends an IRP. For more information, see [DispatchPnP Routines](dispatchpnp-routines.md).

For a list of PnP minor IRPs, see [Plug and Play Minor IRPs](plug-and-play-minor-irps.md).

All drivers for a device must have the opportunity to respond to a PnP IRP unless a driver in the stack fails the IRP. (See the following figure.)

No single driver for a device can assume that it is the only driver that will respond to a PnP IRP. Consider, for example, a function driver that responds to an [**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_CAPABILITIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551664) request and completes the IRP without passing it to the next-lower driver. None of the capabilities supported by lower drivers, such as a unique instance ID or power management capabilities supported by the parent bus driver, is reported.

A PnP IRP travels back up the device stack when the parent bus driver calls [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) and the I/O manager calls any [*IoCompletion*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548354) routines registered by the function driver or filter drivers.

A function or filter driver must do the following when it receives a PnP IRP:

-   If the driver performs actions in response to the IRP:
    1.  Perform the appropriate actions.
    2.  Set **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to an appropriate status, such as STATUS\_SUCCESS. Set **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information**, if appropriate for the IRP.
    3.  Set up the next stack location with [**IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550355) or [**IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548387). Call the latter routine if you set an *IoCompletion* routine.
    4.  Set an *IoCompletion* routine, if necessary.
    5.  Do not complete the IRP. (Do not call **IoCompleteRequest**.) The parent bus driver will complete the IRP.
-   If the driver does not perform actions for this IRP, it simply prepares to pass the IRP to the next driver:
    1.  Call **IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation** to remove its stack location from the IRP.
    2.  Do not set any fields in **Irp-&gt;IoStatus**.
    3.  Do not set an *IoCompletion* routine.
    4.  Do not complete the IRP. (Do not call **IoCompleteRequest**.) The parent bus driver will complete the IRP.

If a function or filter driver did not fail the IRP, it passes the IRP to the next-lower driver with [**IoCallDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548336). A driver has a pointer to the next-lower driver; that pointer was returned from the [**IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548300) call in the higher driver's [*AddDevice*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521) routine.

The parent bus driver completes the IRP after performing any tasks to respond to the IRP. After the bus driver calls **IoCompleteRequest**, the I/O manager calls any *IoCompletion* routines registered by the function or filter drivers for the device.

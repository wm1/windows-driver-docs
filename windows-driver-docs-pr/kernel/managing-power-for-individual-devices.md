# Managing Power for Individual Devices


## <a href="" id="ddk-managing-power-for-individual-devices-kg"></a>


Drivers manage power for their devices by responding to [system power state](system-power-states.md) changes, detecting and shutting down idle devices, and powering up devices when they are needed.

This section covers the following topics related to device power management:

[Device Power States](device-power-states.md)

[Detecting an Idle Device](detecting-an-idle-device.md)

[Managing Device Power Policy](managing-device-power-policy.md)

[Handling IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER for Device Power States](handling-irp-mn-set-power-for-device-power-states.md)

[Handling IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER for Device Power States](handling-irp-mn-query-power-for-device-power-states.md)

[Sending IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER or IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER for Device Power States](sending-irp-mn-query-power-or-irp-mn-set-power-for-device-power-states.md)

[Detecting an Idle Device](detecting-an-idle-device.md)

[Supporting D3cold in a Driver](supporting-d3cold-in-a-driver.md)

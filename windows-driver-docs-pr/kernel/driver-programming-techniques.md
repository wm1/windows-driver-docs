# Driver Programming Techniques


Programming drivers in the kernel mode of Windows requires techniques that sometimes differ significantly from those of ordinary user-mode programming. While the fundamentals of programming may never change, the world of the kernel is very different.

This section includes the following topics:

[Using Nt and Zw Versions of the Native System Services Routines](using-nt-and-zw-versions-of-the-native-system-services-routines.md)

[Synchronization Techniques](synchronization-techniques.md)

[Using Common Log File System](using-common-log-file-system.md)

[Using Kernel Transaction Manager](using-kernel-transaction-manager.md)

[Dynamic Hardware Partitioning Techniques](dynamic-hardware-partitioning-techniques.md)

[Miscellaneous Driver Programming Techniques](miscellaneous-driver-programming-techniques.md)

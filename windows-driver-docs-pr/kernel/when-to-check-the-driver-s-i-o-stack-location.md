# When to Check the Driver's I/O Stack Location


## <a href="" id="ddk-when-to-check-the-driver-s-i-o-stack-location-kg"></a>


A major I/O function code is set in the driver's [I/O stack location](i-o-stack-locations.md) for each incoming IRP.

A driver's dispatch routine must check the driver's I/O stack location for the IRP to determine what to do if any of the following conditions hold:

-   The dispatch routine handles more than one major I/O function code.

-   The dispatch routine must handle a set of minor function codes for certain major function codes. IRPs with minor function codes include [**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550772) and [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550784), as well as certain IRPs that the SCSI port driver and file system drivers must handle.

-   The dispatch routine of a device driver or of a closely coupled higher-level driver handles [**IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550744) or [**IRP\_MJ\_INTERNAL\_DEVICE\_CONTROL**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550766) requests, which have an associated set of I/O control codes.

To get a pointer to a driver's I/O stack location, its dispatch routine calls [**IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549174).

Higher-level drivers' dispatch routines always call **IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation** and also call [**IoGetNextIrpStackLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549266) to get a pointer to the next-lower driver's I/O stack location for IRPs that they set up for the next-lower driver, when [passing IRPs down the driver stack](passing-irps-down-the-driver-stack.md).

The [*DispatchDeviceControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543287) routine or [*DispatchInternalDeviceControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543326) routine of a device driver, or possibly of its closely coupled class driver(s), must determine which I/O control code is set in the driver's I/O stack location at **Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode** for each request. The I/O control code is contained in the driver's I/O stack location.

In most cases, the *DispatchDeviceControl* or *DispatchInternalDeviceControl* routine of a higher-level driver simply passes an **IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL** or **IRP\_MJ\_INTERNAL\_DEVICE\_CONTROL** request on to the next-lower driver, after setting up its stack location in the IRP. However, SCSI class drivers must check for certain [SCSI Port I/O control codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565367) so that they can set up the SCSI port driver's I/O stack location correctly before passing on these requests.

# Writing a DriverEntry Routine


## <a href="" id="ddk-writing-a-driverentry-routine-kg"></a>


Each driver must have a [**DriverEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544113) routine, which initializes driver-wide data structures and resources. The I/O manager calls the **DriverEntry** routine when it loads the driver.

In a driver that supports Plug and Play (PnP), as all drivers should, the **DriverEntry** routine is responsible for *driver* initialization, while the [*AddDevice*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521) routine (and, possibly, the dispatch routine that handles a PnP [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749) request) is responsible for *device* initialization. Driver initialization includes exporting the driver's other entry points, initializing certain objects the driver uses, and setting up various per-driver system resources. (Non-PnP drivers have significantly different requirements, as described in the Driver Development Kit \[DDK\] for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and earlier.)

**DriverEntry** routines are called in the context of a system thread at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL.

A **DriverEntry** routine can be pageable and should be in an INIT segment so it will be discarded. Use an **alloc\_text** pragma directive, as illustrated in the sample drivers that are provided with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

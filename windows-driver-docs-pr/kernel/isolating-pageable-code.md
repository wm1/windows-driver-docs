# Isolating Pageable Code


## <a href="" id="ddk-isolating-pageable-code-kg"></a>


A routine that uses a spin lock cannot be paged. However, in some cases you can isolate the operations that require a spin lock in a separate routine that will not be included in the pageable section.

For example, consider the following fragment:

```
//  PAGED_CODE(); 
 
KeInitializeEvent( &event, NotificationEvent, FALSE ); 
irp = IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest( IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, 
                                     DeviceObject, 
                                     (PVOID) NULL, 
                                     0, 
                                     (PVOID) NULL, 
                                     0, 
                                     FALSE, 
                                     &event, 
                                     &ioStatus ); 
if (irp) { 
   irpSp = IoGetNextIrpStackLocation( irp ); 
   irpSp->MajorFunction = IRP_MJ_FILE_SYSTEM_CONTROL; 
   irpSp->MinorFunction = IRP_MN_LOAD_FILE_SYSTEM; 
   status = IoCallDriver( DeviceObject, irp ); 
   if (status == STATUS_PENDING) { 
   (VOID) KeWaitForSingleObject( &event, 
                                 Executive, 
                                 KernelMode, 
                                 FALSE, 
                                 (PLARGE_INTEGER) NULL ); 
   } 
} 

SPINLOCKUSE ! 
KeAcquireSpinLock( &IopDatabaseLock, &irql ); 
// Code inside spin lock ...

DeviceObject->ReferenceCount--; 
 
if (!DeviceObject->ReferenceCount && !DeviceObject->AttachedDevice) { 
   //Unload the driver
   .
   .
   . 
} else { 
   KeReleaseSpinLock( &IopDatabaseLock, irql ); 
} 
```

The preceding routine could be made pageable (saving about 160 bytes) by moving the few lines of code that reference a spin lock into a separate routine.

In addition, remember that driver code must not be marked as pageable if it calls any **Ke*Xxx*** support routines, such as [**KeReleaseMutex**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553140) or [**KeReleaseSemaphore**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553143), in which the *Wait* parameter is set to **TRUE**. Such a call returns with IRQL at DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

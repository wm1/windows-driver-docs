# DispatchCreate, DispatchClose, and DispatchCreateClose Routines


## <a href="" id="ddk-dispatchcreate-dispatchclose-and-dispatchcreateclose-routines-kg"></a>


A driver's [*DispatchCreate*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543266) and [*DispatchClose*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543255) routines handle IRPs with I/O function codes of [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550729) and [**IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550720), respectively. Alternatively, a combined [*DispatchCreateClose*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543270) routine can handle IRPs for both of these I/O function codes.

A create request can originate either from a user-mode subsystem's attempt to get a handle to a file object representing a device (possibly on behalf of an application or subsystem-level driver) or in a higher-level driver's call to [**IoGetDeviceObjectPointer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549198) or [**IoAttachDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548294).

A reciprocal close request originates from a user-mode subsystem's close of the file object handle associated with the driver's device object.

Each of these requests is inherently synchronous.

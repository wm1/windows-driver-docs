# Powering Up a Device


## <a href="" id="ddk-powering-up-a-device-kg"></a>


When a bus driver handles a PnP [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749) request for one of its child devices, it should power on the device and call [**PoSetPowerState**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559765) to report the device power state to the power manager. Powering on the device is an implicit part of device start-up. The device power policy owner does not send an [**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744) request for **PowerDeviceD0**, so drivers should not expect to receive these IRPs at start-up.

When a device has been powered down to conserve power, its drivers should power it up when an I/O request arrives. In this case, the device power policy owner must send an **IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER** to return the device to the working state. When the IRP completes, the drivers for the device stop queuing I/O and begin to process requests off the queue.

<td><strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong></td>
<td><p>Wdm.h</p></td>
<td><p>The <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> macro modifies the system's [<strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550659) array pointer, so that when the current driver calls the next-lower driver, that driver receives the same <strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong> structure that the current driver received.</p>
<p><em>Irp [in, out]</em></p>
<p><strong>PIRP</strong></p>
<p>A pointer to the IRP.</p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong></p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p>When your driver sends an IRP to the next-lower driver, your driver can call <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> if you do not intend to provide an [<em>IoCompletion</em>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548354) routine (the address of which is stored in the driver's [<strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550659) structure). If you call <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> before calling [<strong>IoCallDriver</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548336), the next-lower driver receives the same <strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong> that your driver received.</p>
<p>If you intend to provide an <em>IoCompletion</em> routine for the IRP, your driver should call [<strong>IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548387) instead of <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong>. If a badly written driver makes the mistake of calling <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> and then setting a completion routine, this driver might overwrite a completion routine set by the driver below it.</p>
<p>If the driver has pended an IRP, the driver should not be calling <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> before it passes the IRP to the next lower driver. If the driver calls <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong> on a pended IRP before passing it to the next lower driver, the SL_PENDING_RETURNED flag is still set in the <strong>Control</strong> member of the I/O stack location for the next driver. Because the next driver owns that stack location and might modify it, it could potentially clear the pending flag. This situation might cause the operating system to issue a bug check or the processing of the IRP to never be completed.</p>
<p>Instead, a driver that has pended an IRP should call <strong>IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext</strong> to set up a new stack location for the next lower driver before it calls <strong>IoCallDriver</strong>.</p>
<p>If your driver calls <strong>IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</strong>, be careful not to modify the <strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong> structure in a way that could unintentionally affect the lower driver or the system's behavior with respect to that driver. Examples include modifying the <strong>IO_STACK_LOCATION</strong> structure's <strong>Parameters</strong> union or calling [<strong>IoMarkIrpPending</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549422).</p>

<td><strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong></td>
<td><p>Wdm.h</p></td>
<td><p>Your driver can use the <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> macro as a bad pointer value to assign to a pointer variable that is either uninitialized or no longer valid. An attempt to access the memory location pointed to by this invalid pointer variable will cause a bug check.</p>
<p>On many hardware platforms, address 0 (frequently represented as named constant <strong>NULL</strong>) is an invalid address, but driver developers should not assume that address 0 is universally invalid across all platforms. Setting uninitialized or invalid pointer variables to address 0 might not always guarantee that inappropriate accesses through these pointers will be detected.</p>
<p>In contrast, the value <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> is guaranteed to be an invalid address on every platform on which a driver runs.</p>
<p>On platforms on which address 0 is an invalid address, a driver that accesses address 0 at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL causes an exception (access violation) that can be inadvertently caught by a <code>try/except</code> statement. Thus, the driver's exception handling code might mask the invalid access and prevent it from being detected during debugging. However, an access of the <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> address is guaranteed to cause a bug check, which cannot be masked by an exception handler.</p>
<p>The following code example shows how to assign the value <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> to a pointer variable named <code>ptr</code>. The Ntdef.h header file defines the PUCHAR type to be a pointer to an <code>unsigned char</code>.</p>
<div class="code">
```
PUCHAR ptr = (PUCHAR)MM_BAD_POINTER;  // Now *ptr is guaranteed to fault.
```
</div>
<p>After <code>ptr</code> is set to <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong>, an attempt to access the memory location pointed to by <code>ptr</code> will cause a bug check.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> is the base address of an entire page of invalid addresses. Therefore, any access of an address in the range <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> to (<strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> + <strong>PAGE_SIZE</strong> - 1) will cause a bug check.</p>
<p>Starting with WindowsÂ 8.1, the <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> macro is defined in the Wdm.h header file. However, driver code that uses this macro definition can run in previous versions of Windows starting with WindowsÂ Vista.</p>
<p>Starting with WindowsÂ Vista, the [<strong>MmBadPointer</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554494) global variable is available as a pointer to a pointer value that is guaranteed to be an invalid address. However, starting with WindowsÂ 8.1, the use of <strong>MmBadPointer</strong> is deprecated, and you should update your drivers to use the <strong>MM_BAD_POINTER</strong> macro instead.</p>
Available starting with WindowsÂ 8.1. Compatible with previous versions of Windows starting with WindowsÂ Vista.</td>

<td><strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong></td>

<td><p>The <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> macro returns a nonpaged system-space virtual address for the buffer that the specified MDL describes.</p>
<p><em>Mdl [in]</em></p>
<p><strong>PMDL</strong></p>
<p>Pointer to a buffer whose corresponding base virtual address is to be mapped.</p>
<p><em>Priority [in]</em></p>
<p><strong>MM_PAGE_PRIORITY</strong></p>
<p>Specifies an <strong>MM_PAGE_PRIORITY</strong> value that indicates the importance of success under low available PTE conditions. Specify a priority value of <strong>LowPagePriority</strong>, <strong>NormalPagePriority</strong>, or <strong>HighPagePriority</strong>. Starting with WindowsÂ 8, the specified priority value can be bitwise-ORed with the <strong>MdlMappingNoWrite</strong> or <strong>MdlMappingNoExecute</strong> flags.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>LowPagePriority</strong> indicates that the mapping request can fail if the system is fairly low on resources. An example of this situation is a noncritical network connection where the driver can handle the mapping failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NormalPagePriority</strong> indicates that the mapping request can fail if the system is very low on resources. An example of this situation is a noncritical local file system request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HighPagePriority</strong> indicates that the mapping request must not fail unless the system is completely out of resources. An example of this situation is the paging file path in a driver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MdlMappingNoWrite</strong> indicates that the mapped physical pages are to be configured as no-write (read only) memory. Starting with WindowsÂ 8, this flag bit can be bitwise-ORed with the <strong>MM_PAGE_PRIORITY</strong> value to specify memory in which writes are disabled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MdlMappingNoExecute</strong> indicates that the mapped physical pages are to be configured as no-execute memory. Starting with WindowsÂ 8, this flag bit can be bitwise-ORed with the <strong>MM_PAGE_PRIORITY</strong> value to specify memory in which instruction execution is disabled. As a best practice, drivers written for WindowsÂ 8 and later versions of Windows should always specify no-execute memory unless executable memory is explicitly required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Return value</strong></p>
<p><strong>PVOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> returns the base system-space virtual address that maps the physical pages that the specified MDL describes. If the pages are not already mapped to system address space and the attempt to map them fails, <strong>NULL</strong> is returned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This routine maps the physical pages that are described by the specified MDL into system address space, if they are not already mapped to system address space.</p>
<p>Drivers of programmed-I/O (PIO) devices call this routine to map a user-mode buffer, which is described by the MDL at <strong>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</strong> and which is already mapped to a user-mode virtual address range, to a range in system address space.</p>
<p>On entry to this routine, the specified MDL must describe physical pages that are locked down. A locked-down MDL can be built by using the [<strong>MmProbeAndLockPages</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554664), [<strong>MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554498), [<strong>IoBuildPartialMdl</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548324), or [<strong>MmAllocatePagesForMdlEx</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554489) routine.</p>
<p>When the system-address-space mapping that is returned by <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> is no longer needed, it must be released. The steps that are required to release the mapping depend on how the MDL was built. These are the four possible cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the MDL was built by a call to the <strong>MmProbeAndLockPages</strong> routine, it is not necessary to explicitly release the system-address-space mapping. Instead, a call to the [<strong>MmUnlockPages</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556381) routine releases the mapping, if one was allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>If the MDL was built by a call to the <strong>MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool</strong> routine, <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> reuses the existing system-address-space mapping instead of creating a new one. In this case, no cleanup is required (that is, unlocking and unmapping are not necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>If the MDL was built by a call to the <strong>IoBuildPartialMdl</strong> routine, the driver must call either the [<strong>MmPrepareMdlForReuse</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554660) routine or the [<strong>IoFreeMdl</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549126) routine to release the system-address-space mapping.</p></li>
<li><p>If the MDL was built by a call to the <strong>MmAllocatePagesForMdlEx</strong> routine, the driver must call the <strong>MmUnmapLockedPages</strong> routine to release the system-address-space mapping. If <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> is called more than one time for an MDL, subsequent <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> calls simply return the mapping that was created by the first call. One call to <strong>MmUnmapLockedPages</strong> is sufficient to release this mapping.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, it is not necessary to explicitly call <strong>MmUnmapLockedPages</strong> for an MDL that was created by <strong>MmAllocatePagesForMdlEx</strong>. Instead, a call to the [<strong>MmFreePagesFromMdl</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554521) routine releases the system-address-space mapping, if one was allocated.</p>
<p>To create a new system-address-space mapping, <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> calls <strong>MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache</strong> with the <em>CacheType</em> parameter set to <strong>MmCached</strong>. A driver that requires a cache type other than <strong>MmCached</strong> should call <strong>MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache</strong> directly instead of calling <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong>. For more information about the <em>CacheType</em> parameter, see [<strong>MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554629).</p>
<p>In a call to <strong>MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache</strong>, the specified cache type is used only if the pages that are described by the MDL do not already have a cache type associated with them. However, in nearly all cases, the pages already have an associated cache type, and this cache type is used by the new mapping. An exception to this rule is for pages that are allocated by <strong>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</strong>, which sets the cache type to <strong>MmCached</strong> regardless of the original cache type of the pages.</p>
<p>Only one thread at a time can safely call <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> for a particular MDL because this routine assumes that the calling thread owns the MDL. However, <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong> can be called more than one time for the same MDL either by making all calls from the same thread or, if the calls are from multiple threads, by explicitly synchronizing the calls.</p>
<p>If a driver must split a request into smaller requests, the driver can allocate additional MDLs, or the driver can use the <strong>IoBuildPartialMdl</strong> routine.</p>
<p>The returned base address has the same offset as the virtual address in the MDL.</p>
<p>Windows 98 does not support <strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe</strong>. Use [<strong>MmGetSystemAddressForMdl</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554556) instead.</p>
<p>Because this macro calls [<strong>MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554629), using it may require linking to NtosKrnl.lib.</p>

<strong>Note</strong>Â Â  The [<strong>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559759) routine is a direct replacement for the <strong>PoSetDeviceBusy</strong> macro.

</div>
<p>A driver uses <strong>PoSetDeviceBusy</strong> along with <strong>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</strong> to enable system idle detection for its device. If a device that is registered for idle detection becomes idle, the power manager sends an [<strong>IRP_MN_SET_POWER</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744) request to put the device in a requested sleep state.</p>
<p><strong>PoSetDeviceBusy</strong> reports that the device is busy, so that the power manager can restart its idle countdown. If the device is not powered up, <strong>PoSetDeviceBusy</strong> does not change its state. That is, it does not cause the system to send a power-on request.</p>
<p>A driver should call <strong>PoSetDeviceBusy</strong> on every I/O request.</p>

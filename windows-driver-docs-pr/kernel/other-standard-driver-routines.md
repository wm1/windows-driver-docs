# Other Standard Driver Routines


## <a href="" id="ddk-other-standard-driver-routines-kg"></a>


As the [driver object illustration](introduction-to-driver-objects.md#driver-object-illustration) shows, kernel-mode drivers have other standard routines along with those for which they set entry points in their respective driver objects. Most standard driver routines and some of the configuration-dependent objects they use are defined by the I/O manager. The ISR, *SynchCritSection* routine, and those shown in the Driver Object figure with names containing the word "custom" are defined by the NT kernel.

Most drivers use the [device extension](device-extensions.md) of each device object they create to maintain device-specific state about their I/O operations and to store pointers to any system resources that they must allocate in order to have other standard routines. For example, the **DDCustomTimerDpc** routine shown in the Driver Object figure requires the driver to supply storage for kernel-defined timer and DPC objects.

The set of standard driver routines for lowest-level drivers shown on the left in the [driver object illustration](introduction-to-driver-objects.md#driver-object-illustration) is necessarily different from the set for higher-level drivers. Some of the routines shown in this figure are device-dependent or configuration-dependent requirements. Others are optional: you may choose to implement such a routine depending on the nature or configuration of the driver's devices, on the driver's design, and on the driver's position in a chain of layered drivers.

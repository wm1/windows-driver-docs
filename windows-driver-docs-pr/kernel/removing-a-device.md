# Removing a Device


## <a href="" id="ddk-removing-a-device-kg"></a>


The PnP manager directs drivers to remove their device objects for a device when the device has been, or is being, physically removed from the machine. The PnP manager also sends a *remove* IRP when a user requests to update the drivers for a device and, on Windows 2000 and later, when the device is disabled or fails to start.

The following sections describe when the PnP manager issues *remove* IRPs and what drivers must do to respond to those IRPs. This section covers the following topics:

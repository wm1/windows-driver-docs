# Named Device Objects


## <a href="" id="ddk-named-device-objects-kg"></a>


A device object, like all object manager objects, can be named or unnamed. When a user-mode application makes an I/O request, it specifies the target of the operation by name. The object manager resolves the name to determine the destination of the I/O request.

A driver can specify a name for a device object when it calls [**IoCreateDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548397) or [**IoCreateDeviceSecure**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548407) to create the device object. For more information about when and how to name a device object, see [NT Device Names](nt-device-names.md).

A named device object can also have an MS-DOS device name, which is a symbolic link created by [**IoCreateSymbolicLink**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549043) or [**IoCreateUnprotectedSymbolicLink**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549050). WDM drivers do not in general require an MS-DOS device name. For more information, see [MS-DOS Device Names](ms-dos-device-names.md).

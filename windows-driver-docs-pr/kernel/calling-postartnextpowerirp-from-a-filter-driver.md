# Calling PoStartNextPowerIrp from a Filter Driver


Beginning with Windows Vista, calling [**PoStartNextPowerIrp**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559776) is not required and call to this routine performs no power management operation. However, in Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000, a filter driver must call **PoStartNextPowerIrp** once for every [**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551699) or [**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744) request that the driver receives. When the call occurs depends on the type of request and whether the driver will fail or succeed the request, as the following table shows.

<table>
<colgroup>

</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type of request</th>
<th>If driver succeeds the request, the call occurs:</th>
<th>If driver fails the request, the call occurs:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER</strong> (device power state)</p></td>
<td><p>In an [<em>IoCompletion</em>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548354) routine, immediately before returning.</p></td>
<td><p>In [<em>DispatchPower</em>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543354) routine, before calling <strong>IoCompleteRequest</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER</strong> (system power state)</p></td>
<td><p>In <em>DispatchPower</em> routine, after acquiring remove lock and before setting IRP stack location.</p></td>
<td><p>In <em>DispatchPower</em> routine, before calling [<strong>IoCompleteRequest</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>IRP_MN_SET_POWER</strong> (device power state)</p></td>
<td><p>In an <em>IoCompletion</em> routine, immediately before returning.</p></td>
<td><p>Not allowed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>IRP_MN_SET_POWER</strong> (system power state)</p></td>
<td><p>In <em>DispatchPower</em> routine, after acquiring remove lock and before setting IRP stack location.</p></td>
<td><p>Not allowed.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# Performing Device-Specific Idle Detection


## <a href="" id="ddk-performing-device-specific-idle-detection-kg"></a>


Instead of using the power manager's idle detection routines, a driver can perform its own idle detection based on device-specific criteria.

Such a driver should put its idle device in the lowest possible sleep state that is valid for the current system power state. To do so, the driver requests a power IRP ([**PoRequestPowerIrp**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559734)) with minor IRP code [**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744), specifying the device power state to which the device should transition.

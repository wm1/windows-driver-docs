# IoTimer Routines


## <a href="" id="ddk-iotimer-routines-kg"></a>


Drivers that need to be called periodically to determine if a device operation has timed out, to update some driver-defined variable (such as a counter), or to time any operation for which small time intervals are not required, can use an [*IoTimer*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550381) routine. An *IoTimer* routine is actually a DPC routine, associated with a device object, that the I/O manager calls once per second. A driver can have an *IoTimer* routine for each device object that it creates.

In general, a driver should use an *IoTimer* routine to time operations that require regular one-second intervals. To time operations that require variable intervals or intervals shorter than once per second, a driver should allocate a timer object. For more information, see [Timer Objects and DPCs](timer-objects-and-dpcs.md).

# NX Pool Opt-In Mechanisms


To port kernel-mode driver code to Windows 8 from earlier versions of Windows, you should use the **NonPagedPoolNx** type of memory pool as a best practice. You can use one of several porting aids to easily "opt in" to use the **NonPagedPoolNx** pool type by default.

These porting aids use one or both of the following techniques to enable the driver to use NX nonpaged pool:

-   Use a `#define` preprocessor statement to create a globally defined macro name.

-   Call an inline function from the [**DriverEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544113) routine.

For most kernel-mode driver code, these porting aids enable developers to update their drivers with minimal effort.

This porting aid builds a separate driver binary for Windows 8 and for each earlier version of Windows that your driver supports.</p></td>

<td><p>You can globally enable one of the no-execute (NX) pool opt-in mechanisms for a set of driver source files, and then override this opt-in mechanism for one or more selected source files with POOL_NX_OPTOUT. This allows the selected source files to continue to use executable nonpaged memory. You can use the POOL_NX_OPTOUT opt-out mechanism with either the POOL_NX_OPTIN or the POOL_NX_OPTIN_AUTO opt-in mechanism.</p></td>

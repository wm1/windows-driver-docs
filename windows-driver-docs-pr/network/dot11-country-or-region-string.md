# DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

The **DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING** array defines an 802.11 regulatory domain. For more information about country strings and regulatory domains, refer to the IEEE 802.11d-2001 standard.

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef UCHAR DOT11_COUNTRY_OR_REGION_STRING[3];
```

**DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING**  
A 3-byte string that identifies the country in which the 802.11 station is operating.

****  

Remarks
-------

The first two bytes of the **DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING** array are the country code as described in the ISO/IEC 3166-1 standard. The third byte must be one of the following:

-   An ASCII space character (0x20) if the regulations under which the 802.11 station is operating encompass all environments in the country.

-   An ASCII 'O' character (0x4F) if the regulations under which the 802.11 station is operating are for an outdoor environment only.

-   An ASCII 'I' character (0x49) if the regulations under which the 802.11 station is operating are for an indoor environment only.

A **DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING** array with a value of all zeros is used to specify a null country string.

The PDOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING type is defined as a pointer to the DOT11\_COUNTRY\_OR\_REGION\_STRING type as follows:

```
typedef DOT11_COUNTRY_OR_REGION_STRING  *PDOT11_COUNTRY_OR_REGION_STRING;
```

# OID\_GEN\_INTERFACE\_INFO


As a query, use the OID\_GEN\_INTERFACE\_INFO OID to obtain the current state and statistics information for a network interface.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later"></a>Windows Vista and later  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Not requested. For NDIS interface providers only.

Remarks
-------

Only [NDIS network interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566527) providers, and therefore not miniport drivers or filter drivers, must support this OID as an OID request.

If the query succeeds, the interface provider returns NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS, and the result of the query is an [**NDIS\_INTERFACE\_INFORMATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565736) structure. This structure contains information that changes during the lifetime of the interface.

Requirements
------------

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Header</p></td>
<td>Ntddndis.h (include Ndis.h)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

A miniport driver makes an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START indication before the 802.11 station begins a roaming operation.

The miniport driver indicates the completion of the roaming operation through the [NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_COMPLETION](ndis-status-dot11-roaming-completion.md) indication. Every NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START indication made by the driver must have a corresponding NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_COMPLETION indication.

For more information about the roaming operation, see [Roaming Operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570717).

The data type for this indication is the [**DOT11\_ROAMING\_START\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548764) structure:

The miniport driver can make the NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START indication only after it has completed a connection operation with a BSS network. For more information about connection operations, see [Connection Operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545185).

Before it initiates a roaming operation, the miniport driver must allocate all of the resources that it will need to make the corresponding [NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_COMPLETION](ndis-status-dot11-roaming-completion.md) indication.

The miniport driver calls [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) to make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START indication, and must pass a pointer to an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure through the *StatusIndication* parameter. When making this indication, the driver must set the following members of the NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION structure:

-   **StatusCode** must be set to NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_ROAMING\_START.

-   **StatusBuffer** must be set to the address of a DOT11\_ROAMING\_START\_PARAMETERS structure.

-   **StatusBufferSize** must be set to sizeof(DOT11\_ROAMING\_START\_PARAMETERS).

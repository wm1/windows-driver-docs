# HS\_NETWORK\_PROFILE structure


The **HS\_NETWORK\_PROFILE** structure is provided by the plugin and contains information required for connection to the target network. Each instance of the Network Profile is uniquely associated with a corresponding [**HS\_NETWORK\_IDENTITY**](hs-network-identity.md) structure.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef struct _HS_NETWORK_PROFILE {
  DWORD  dwNetworkCapabilities;
  USHORT usPriority;
  DWORD  dwSupportedSIMCount;
  DWORD  dmNumCellularExceptions;
  DWORD  dwNetworkStringID;
  DWORD  dwKeepAliveTimeMins;
  WCHAR  szRealm[HS_CONST_MAX_REALM_LENGTH+1];
} HS_NETWORK_PROFILE, *PHS_NETWORK_PROFILE;
```

Members
-------

**dwNetworkCapabilities**  
A subset of the possible **HS\_FLAG\_CAPABILITY\_NETWORK\_\*** values. For more information about hotspot host capabilities, see [**Wi-Fi Hotspot Offloading Constants**](wi-fi-hotspot-offloading-constants.md).

**usPriority**  
A unique priority value assigned to the associated network. It must be a value between 1 and 65000 (a hidden network must have a value of 1). A lower numeric value corresponds to a higher priority.

**dwSupportedSIMCount**  
Supported SIM count. This member is set for HTTP-based and EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA' authentication.

**dmNumCellularExceptions**  
Optional. Number of host connections over cellular only.

**dwNetworkStringID**  
Network name string ID. Maximum string size = MAX\_NETWORK\_DISPLAY\_NAME\_LENGTH.

**dwKeepAliveTimeMins**  
Optional. The time interval between network connection keep-alive messages.

**szRealm**  
Network-specific realm value.

# NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

A miniport driver must make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED status indication after it has adopted a channel or frequency to communicate with a peer station on an infrastructure BSS. This indication must be made any time the NIC adopts a new channel or frequency or has started an AP.

The data type for this indication is the [**DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548735) structure.

The NIC should treat the available operating channels or frequencies returned by [OID\_DOT11\_AVAILABLE\_CHANNEL\_LIST](oid-dot11-available-channel-list.md) and [OID\_DOT11\_AVAILABLE\_FREQUENCY\_LIST](oid-dot11-available-frequency-list.md) as suggestions. The NIC is free to adopt its own channel or frequency that meets the local regulatory domain.

The miniport driver calls [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) to make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED indication, and must pass a pointer to an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure through the *StatusIndication* parameter. When the driver makes this indication, it must set the following members of the NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION structure:

-   **StatusCode** must be set to NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED.

-   **StatusBuffer** must be set to the address of a DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED\_PARAMETERS structure.

-   **StatusBufferSize** must be set to sizeof(DOT11\_PHY\_FREQUENCY\_ADOPTED\_PARAMETERS).

# OID\_DOT11\_MAXIMUM\_LIST\_SIZE


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When queried, the OID\_DOT11\_MAXIMUM\_LIST\_SIZE object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver return the maximum number of multicast addresses supported by the 802.11 station.

The data type for this OID is a ULONG value.

For more information about how multicast addresses are added or deleted, see [OID\_DOT11\_MULTICAST\_LIST](oid-dot11-multicast-list.md).

# OID\_GEN\_HD\_SPLIT\_PARAMETERS


As a set, NDIS and overlying drivers or user-mode applications use the OID\_GEN\_HD\_SPLIT\_PARAMETERS OID to set the current header-data split settings of a miniport adapter. NDIS 6.1 and later miniport drivers that provide header-data split services must support this OID. Otherwise, this OID is optional.

Remarks
-------

The **InformationBuffer** member of [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains an [**NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565701) structure.

NDIS might set the OID\_GEN\_HD\_SPLIT\_PARAMETERS OID when an NDIS 5.*x* protocol driver binds to an NDIS 6.1 miniport. NDIS processes this OID before passing it to the miniport driver and updates the miniport adapter's **\*HeaderDataSplit** standardized keyword, if required. If header-data split is disabled, NDIS does not send this OID to the miniport adapter.

NDIS will send this OID to the miniport driver only if header-data split was enabled with the NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_ENABLE\_HEADER\_DATA\_SPLIT flag in the [**NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565694) structure during miniport initialization.

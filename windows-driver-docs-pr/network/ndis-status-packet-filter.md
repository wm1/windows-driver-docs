# NDIS\_STATUS\_PACKET\_FILTER


The NDIS\_STATUS\_PACKET\_FILTER status indicates a packet filter change to overlying drivers. NDIS generates this status indications for a miniport adapter to notify overlying drivers that there might be a change in the miniport adapter's packet filter setting.

Remarks
-------

NDIS does not guarantee that the packet filter has changed when NDIS generates the NDIS\_STATUS\_PACKET\_FILTER status indication.

NDIS filter drivers can also generate the NDIS\_STATUS\_PACKET\_FILTER status indication.

NDIS supplies a bitwise OR of the filter type flags in the **StatusBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure. For a list of the filter type flags, see the [OID\_GEN\_CURRENT\_PACKET\_FILTER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569575) OID. For additional information about packet filters, see [OID\_GEN\_SUPPORTED\_PACKET\_FILTERS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569643).

The **StatusBufferSize** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure is set to sizeof(ULONG).

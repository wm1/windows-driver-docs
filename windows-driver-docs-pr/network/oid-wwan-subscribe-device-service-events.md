# OID\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS


OID\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS sets information about the list of device services for which the MB device must send [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh846204) notifications. The MB device should not indicate events for any device service which is not in this list.

Miniport drivers must process set requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending a [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SUBSCRIPTION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh846209) status notification that contains the current list of event subscriptions on the MB device.

Callers requesting to set the MB device service event subscription list provide a [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439843) structure to the miniport driver with the appropriate information.

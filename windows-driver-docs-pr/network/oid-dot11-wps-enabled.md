# OID\_DOT11\_WPS\_ENABLED


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_WPS\_ENABLED object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver set the value of the Boolean **msDot11WpsEnabled** management information base (MIB) object. If **msDot11WpsEnabled** is set to **TRUE**, WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is enabled on the NIC. Otherwise WPS is disabled. The NIC must complete the set request regardless of whether the Extensible AP is in the INIT or OP states.

When queried, this OID requests that the miniport driver return the value of the Boolean **msDot11WpsEnabled** MIB object. If **msDot11AdditionalIEs** is **TRUE**, WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is enabled on the NIC. Otherwise WPS is disabled.

The **msDot11WpsEnabled** object is only applicable to the Extensible AP.

**Note**  Support for this OID is mandatory.

 

The default value of **msDot11WpsEnabled** is **FALSE**. It is reset to the default value whenever an [OID\_DOT11\_RESET\_REQUEST](oid-dot11-reset-request.md) request is received.

If WPS is enabled on a NIC that is operating in Extensible AP mode, the miniport driver must allow peer stations to associate with the Extensible AP by using [Open System Authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569852) or [Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571060) algorithms, regardless of the enabled authorization and cipher algorithms. For these peer stations, the miniport driver must enforce the following:

-   For inbound packets, only unicast 802.1X packets are accepted. Other data packets will be dropped.

-   For outbound packets, only unicast 802.1X packets are allowed to be sent to the stations. Broadcast and multicast packets are not affected.

-   No encryption or decryption is allowed on unicast data packets. Inbound encrypted data packets are dropped.

When WPS is disabled, the miniport driver must disassociate all peer stations that were associated by using Open System Authentication or WEP algorithms if they were not among the enabled authorization and cipher algorithms.

The 802.11 miniport driver should allow only the following pairs of [**DOT11\_AUTH\_ALGORITHM**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547655) and [**DOT11\_CIPHER\_ALGORITHM**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547672) authentication and cipher algorithms, depending on whether WPS is enabled or disabled.

-   **DOT11\_AUTH\_ALGO\_WPA\_PSK/DOT11\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_CCMP**

-   **DOT11\_AUTH\_ALGO\_80211\_OPEN/DOT11\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEPXXX**

-   **DOT11\_AUTH\_ALGO\_80211\_OPEN/DOT11\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_NONE**

<a href="" id="wps-is-disabled-------"></a>**WPS is disabled**   
-   **DOT11\_AUTH\_ALGO\_WPA\_PSK/DOT11\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_CCMP**

**Note**  The NIC's response to 802.11 Beacon or Probe Response frames must not change when WPS is enabled with this OID, even if some peer stations were associated by using Open System Authentication or WEP algorithms.

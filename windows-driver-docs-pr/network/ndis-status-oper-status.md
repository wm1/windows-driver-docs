# NDIS\_STATUS\_OPER\_STATUS


The NDIS\_STATUS\_OPER\_STATUS status indicates the current operational state of an NDIS network interface to overlying drivers.

Remarks
-------

NDIS generates this status indication; NDIS miniport drivers should not generate this status indication.

NDIS supplies an [**NDIS\_OPER\_STATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566737) structure in the **StatusBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure.

The **StatusBufferSize** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure is set to sizeof(NDIS\_OPER\_STATE).

# OID\_WWAN\_SMS\_SEND


OID\_WWAN\_SMS\_SEND sends SMS text messages to another MB device.

Query requests are not supported.

Set requests use the [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SMS\_SEND**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567943) structure.

Miniport drivers process this OID asynchronously, and should return an NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED provisional response to any set requests. Miniport drivers should send an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_SMS\_SEND**](ndis-status-wwan-sms-send.md) indication when they have completed the transaction.

Remarks
-------

For more information about using this OID, see [WWAN SMS Operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559131).

When processing this OID, miniport drivers can access the provider network, but should not access the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM card).

OID\_WWAN\_SMS\_SEND supports sending both PDU-mode and CDMA-mode SMS text messages, depending on the capabilities of the device.

GSM-based devices are expected to support only PDU-mode SMS text messages. CDMA-based devices are expected to support only CDMA-mode SMS text messages. Miniport drivers must be able to complete set requests irrespective of SMS text message mode.

Miniport drivers should return NDIS\_STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED if they do not support SMS text messages, or the ability to send SMS text messages.

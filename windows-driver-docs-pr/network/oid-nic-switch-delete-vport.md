# OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT


An overlying driver issues an object identifier (OID) set request of OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT to delete a nondefault virtual port (VPort) that was previously created on a network adapter's NIC switch. The overlying driver can delete a VPort that it has previously created only by issuing an OID method request of [OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_CREATE\_VPORT](oid-nic-switch-create-vport.md).

Overlying drivers issue this OID set request to the miniport driver for the network adapter's PCIe Physical Function (PF). This OID set request is required for PF miniport drivers that support the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interface.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to the [**NDIS\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451577) structure.

Remarks
-------

An overlying driver, such as a protocol or filter driver, can only delete a nondefault VPort that it has previously created. The overlying driver creates a VPort by issuing an OID method request of [OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_CREATE\_VPORT](oid-nic-switch-create-vport.md).

When the PF miniport driver receives the OID request of OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT, the driver must free the hardware and software resources that were allocated for the specified VPort.

For more information, see [Deleting a Virtual Port](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439418).

**Note**  Only nondefault VPorts can be explicitly deleted through OID requests of OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT. The default VPort is implicitly deleted when the PF miniport driver deletes the default NIC switch. For more information, see [Deleting a NIC Switch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439415).

 

### Return Status Codes

The PF miniport driver returns one of the following status codes for the OID set request of OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_DELETE\_VPORT.

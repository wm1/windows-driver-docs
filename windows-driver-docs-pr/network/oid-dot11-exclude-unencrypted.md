# OID\_DOT11\_EXCLUDE\_UNENCRYPTED


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_EXCLUDE\_UNENCRYPTED OID requests that the miniport driver set the IEEE 802.11 **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** management information base (MIB) object.

When queried, this OID requests that the miniport driver return the setting of the **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** MIB object.

The **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** MIB object specifies how the 802.11 station handles received packets with unencrypted payload data.

**Note**  Support for OID\_DOT11\_EXCLUDE\_UNENCRYPTED is mandatory if the 802.11 station supports any cipher algorithms. The miniport driver returns a list of supported cipher algorithms when [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_UNICAST\_ALGORITHM\_PAIR](oid-dot11-supported-unicast-algorithm-pair.md) or [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_MULTICAST\_ALGORITHM\_PAIR](oid-dot11-supported-multicast-algorithm-pair.md) are queried.

 

The data type for this OID is a BOOLEAN value.

The **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** MIB object defines the following actions:

-   If **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** is **TRUE**, then the 802.11 station must discard any received unicast packets in which the Protected Frame subfield of the Frame Control field in the 802.11 MAC header is set to zero.

-   If **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** is **FALSE**, then the 802.11 station can accept these packets and indicate them to the operating system.

When **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** is **FALSE**, the miniport driver must connect to an access point (AP) with a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) profile, even if the AP does not set the privacy field in the relevant management frames.

The actions defined by the **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** MIB object do not apply to received packets that match an entry in the 802.11 station's current EtherType exemption list. For more information about the EtherType exemption list, see [OID\_DOT11\_PRIVACY\_EXEMPTION\_LIST](oid-dot11-privacy-exemption-list.md).

The default setting for the **dot11ExcludeUnencrypted** MIB object is **FALSE**. The miniport driver must set the MIB object to this default through its [*MiniportInitializeEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559389) function or when reset through [OID\_DOT11\_RESET\_REQUEST](oid-dot11-reset-request.md).

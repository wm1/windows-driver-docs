# Native 802.11 IHV Handler functions

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in WindowsÂ 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

The Native 802.11 IHV Handler functions are provided by the IHV Extensions DLL and are called by the operating system to do the following:

- Allocate and free buffers that are used within the Native 802.11 framework.
- Send packets, such as a packet defined by an authentication algorithm, through the IHV's wireless LAN (WLAN) adapter.
- Receive packets based on a specified list of IEEE EtherType values and privacy exemption rules.
- Configure the IHV's WLAN adapter with various security settings for any proprietary authentication and cipher algorithms.
- Interface with the IHV UI Extensions DLL (if installed) to process event notifications. For example, the IHV Extensions DLL could notify the UI Extensions DLL about the various stages involved in a basic service set (BSS) network connection. 

For more information about the IHV UI Extensions DLL, see [Native 802.11 IHV UI Extensions DLL](native-802-11-ihv-ui-extensions-dll2.md).

> [!NOTE]
> With the exception of [Dot11ExtIhvGetVersionInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547464) and [Dot11ExtIhvInitService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547470), the operating system calls the IHV Handler functions through a function pointer associated with a member of the [DOT11EXT_IHV_HANDLERS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547625) structure. When the operating system calls the *Dot11ExtIhvInitService* IHV Handler function, the IHV Extensions DLL returns the list of pointers to the IHV Handler functions through the *pDot11IHVHandlers* parameter.

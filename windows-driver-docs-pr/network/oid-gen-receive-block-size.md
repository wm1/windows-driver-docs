# OID\_GEN\_RECEIVE\_BLOCK\_SIZE


As a query. the OID\_GEN\_RECEIVE\_BLOCK\_SIZE OID specifies the amount of storage, in bytes, that a single packet occupies in the receive buffer space of the NIC.

**Version Information**

Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-5-1-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 5.1 miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

Remarks
-------

The OID\_GEN\_RECEIVE\_BLOCK\_SIZE OID specifies the amount of storage, in bytes, that a single packet occupies in the receive buffer space of a NIC.

The same information can be obtained from the current and maximum *lookahead* size. However, one of these OIDs can be mandatory to verify each other. Also protocol drivers can determine if the underlying driver indicates full-packet receives by comparing the values that driver returns for the [OID\_GEN\_CURRENT\_LOOKAHEAD](oid-gen-current-lookahead.md) and OID\_GEN\_RECEIVE\_BLOCK\_SIZE OIDs.

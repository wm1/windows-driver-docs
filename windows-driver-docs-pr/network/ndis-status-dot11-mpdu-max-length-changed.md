# NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_CHANGED


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

A miniport driver must make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_CHANGED indication after the maximum media access control (MAC) protocol data unit (MPDU) frame size is changed for a PHY on the 802.11 station.

The data type for this indication is the DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION structure:

```ManagedCPlusPlus
    typedef struct _DOT11_MPDU_MAX_LENGTH_INDICATION {
         NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
         ULONG uPhyId;
         ULONG uMPDUMaxLength;
    } DOT11_MPDU_MAX_LENGTH_INDICATION,   *PDOT11_MPDU_MAX_LENGTH_INDICATION;
  
```

The DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION structure contains the following members:

<a href="" id="header"></a>**Header**  
The type, revision, and size of the DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION structure. This member is formatted as an [**NDIS\_OBJECT\_HEADER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588) structure.

The miniport driver must set the members of **Header** to the following values:

<a href="" id="type"></a>**Type**  
This member must be set to NDIS\_OBJECT\_TYPE\_DEFAULT.

<a href="" id="revision"></a>**Revision**  
This member must be set to DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION\_REVISION\_1.

<a href="" id="size"></a>**Size**  
This member must be set to sizeof(DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION).

For more information about these members, see [**NDIS\_OBJECT\_HEADER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588).

<a href="" id="uphyid"></a>**uPhyId**  
The identifier (ID) of the PHY on which the maximum MPDU length was changed. The PHY ID is the index within the list of supported PHYs that are returned by the driver through a query of [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_PHY\_TYPES](oid-dot11-supported-phy-types.md).

The **uPhyId** member is applicable only for miniport drivers that operate in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode.

<a href="" id="umpdumaxlength"></a>**uMPDUMaxLength**  
The new maximum length for MPDU frames that are supported by the PHY that is identified by the **uPhyId** member.

The **uMPDUMaxLength** member is applicable only for miniport drivers that operate in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode. For more information about the ExtSTA operation mode, see [Extensible Station Operation Mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549887).

The miniport driver calls [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) to make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_CHANGED indication, and must pass a pointer to an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure through the *StatusIndication* parameter.

When making this indication, the miniport driver must set the members of the NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION structure to the following values:

<a href="" id="statuscode"></a>**StatusCode**  
This member must be set to NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_CHANGED.

<a href="" id="statusbuffer"></a>**StatusBuffer**  
This memer must be set to the address of a DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION structure.

<a href="" id="statusbuffersize"></a>**StatusBufferSize**  
This member must be set to sizeof(DOT11\_MPDU\_MAX\_LENGTH\_INDICATION).

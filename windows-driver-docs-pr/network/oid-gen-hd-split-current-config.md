# OID\_GEN\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG


As a query, overlying drivers or administrative utilities can use the OID\_GEN\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG OID to determine the current header-data split configuration of a miniport adapter. A system administrator can use the GUID that is associated with this OID through the WMI interface.

Remarks
-------

NDIS handles this OID on behalf of the miniport driver. NDIS maintains the current header-data split configuration information based on the miniport driver initialization attributes and the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567370) status indication.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains an [**NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565696) structure.

Requirements

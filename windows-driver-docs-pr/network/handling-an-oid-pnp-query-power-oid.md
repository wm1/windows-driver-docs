# Handling an OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER OID


## <a href="" id="ddk-handling-an-oid-pnp-query-power-oid-ng"></a>


The [OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569778) OID requests a miniport driver to indicate whether it can transition a network adapter to a low-power state. A miniport driver must always return NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS in response to a query of OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER. By returning NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS to this OID request, the miniport driver guarantees that it will transition the network adapter to the specified device power state on receipt of a subsequent [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569780) request. The miniport driver, in this case, must do nothing to jeopardize the transition.

An [OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569778) request is always followed by an OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request. The [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569780) request can immediately follow the OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER request or can arrive at an unspecified interval after the OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER request. A device state of D0, which is specified in the OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request, effectively cancels a preceding OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER request.

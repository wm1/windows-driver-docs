# OID\_GEN\_TRANSMIT\_BLOCK\_SIZE


As a query, the OID\_GEN\_TRANSMIT\_BLOCK\_SIZE OID specifies the minimum number of bytes that a single net packet occupies in the transmit buffer space of the NIC.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows"></a>Windows Vista and later versions of Windows  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

<a href="" id="ndis-5-1-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 5.1 miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

<a href="" id="windows-xp"></a>Windows XP  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-5-1-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 5.1 miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

Remarks
-------

The OID\_GEN\_TRANSMIT\_BLOCK\_SIZE OID specifies the minimum number of bytes that a single net packet occupies in the transmit buffer space of the NIC. For example, a NIC that has a transmit space divided into 256-byte pieces would have a transmit block size of 256 bytes. To calculate the total transmit buffer space on such a NIC, its driver multiplies the number of transmit buffers on the NIC by its transmit block size.

For other NICs, the transmit block size is identical to its maximum packet size.

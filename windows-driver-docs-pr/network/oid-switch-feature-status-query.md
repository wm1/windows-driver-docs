# OID\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_QUERY


The protocol edge of the Hyper-V extensible switch issues an object identifier (OID) method request of OID\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_QUERY to obtain custom status information from an extension about the extensible switch. This information is known as *feature status* information. The format of this information is defined by the independent software vendor (ISV).

After a successful return from this OID method request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to a buffer. This buffer contains the following data:

-   An [**NDIS\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598208) structure that specifies the parameters for the type of feature status information to be returned.

-   An [**NDIS\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_CUSTOM**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598207) structure that contains the feature status information for the extensible switch.

Remarks
-------

For guidelines on how to handle an OID set request of OID\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_QUERY, see [Managing Custom Switch Feature Status Information](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598193).

### Return Status Codes

The extension returns one of the following status codes for the OID method request of OID\_SWITCH\_FEATURE\_STATUS\_QUERY.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Status Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</p></td>
<td><p>The OID request completed successfully.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_LENGTH</p></td>
<td><p>The length of the information buffer is too small to return the feature status information as well as the [<strong>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598207) and [<strong>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_PARAMETERS</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598208) structures. The underlying miniport edge of the extensible switch sets the <strong>DATA.METHOD_INFORMATION.BytesNeeded</strong> member in the [<strong>NDIS_OID_REQUEST</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure to the minimum buffer size that is required.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>NDIS_STATUS_FAILURE</p></td>
<td><p>The request failed for other reasons.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

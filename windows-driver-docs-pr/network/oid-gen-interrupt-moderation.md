# OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION


As a query, NDIS and overlying drivers use the OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION OID to determine if interrupt moderation is enabled on a miniport adapter. If the query succeeds, NDIS returns an [**NDIS\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565793) structure that contains the current interrupt moderation settings.

As a set, NDIS and overlying drivers use the OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION OID to enable or disable the interrupt moderation on a miniport adapter.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows"></a>Windows Vista and later versions of Windows  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Mandatory. Set and query.

Remarks
-------

For a query, if a miniport driver does not support interrupt moderation, the driver must specify **NdisInterruptModerationNotSupported** in the **InterruptModeration** member of the NDIS\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION\_PARAMETERS structure.

For a set, if the driver reported **NdisInterruptModerationNotSupported** in response to the OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION query, the driver should return NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_DATA in response to the set request. The miniport driver receives an [**NDIS\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565793) structure. If the **InterruptModeration** member of NDIS\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION\_PARAMETERS is set to **NdisInterruptModerationEnabled**, the miniport driver should enable interrupt moderation. Otherwise, it should disable interrupt moderation.

# Derived NET\_BUFFER\_LIST Structures


## <a href="" id="ddk-derived-net-buffer-list-structures-ng"></a>


NDIS provides functions that drivers can use to manage [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388) structures that are derived from other NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures. These functions are typically used by intermediate drivers.

The following NDIS functions can create derived NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures from an existing NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure:

[**NdisAllocateCloneNetBufferList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560705)

[**NdisAllocateFragmentNetBufferList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560707)

[**NdisAllocateReassembledNetBufferList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561614)

These functions improve system performance because NDIS creates the derived structures without copying the network data. There are three types of [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388) structures that can be derived from an existing NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure:

<a href="" id="clone"></a>Clone  
A cloned NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure is a duplicate that references the original data. Drivers can use this type of structure to efficiently transfer the same data to multiple paths.

<a href="" id="fragment"></a>Fragment  
A fragment [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388) structure includes a set of [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376) structures that reference the original data; however, the data is divided into units that do not exceed a maximum size. Drivers can use this type of structure to efficiently break up large buffers into smaller buffers.

<a href="" id="reassembled"></a>Reassembled  
A reassembled NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure contains a NET\_BUFFER structure that references the original data from multiple source NET\_BUFFER structures. Drivers can use this type of structure to efficiently combine many smaller buffers into a single large buffer.

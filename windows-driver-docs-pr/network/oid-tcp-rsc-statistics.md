# OID\_TCP\_RSC\_STATISTICS


As a query, NDIS and overlying drivers or user-mode applications use the OID\_TCP\_RSC\_STATISTICS OID to get the receive-segment coalescing (RSC) statistics of a miniport adapter.

NDIS 6.30 and later miniport drivers that provide RSC services must support this OID. Otherwise, this OID is optional.

Remarks
-------

The **InformationBuffer** member of [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains an [**NDIS\_RSC\_STATISTICS\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451657) structure.

The miniport driver must maintain the statistics in the members of the [**NDIS\_RSC\_STATISTICS\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451657) structure as follows:

-   The driver must increment the coalesced packet count in the **CoalescedPkts** member by one every time a packet is added to a single coalesced unit (SCU).
-   The driver must increment the coalesced octet count in the **CoalescedOctets** member by the size of the TCP payload of the packet every time a packet is added to a SCU.
-   The driver must increment the coalesced events count **CoalesceEvents** member by one every time a SCU is finalized. All such SCUs should have a non-zero **CoalescedSegCount** value.
-   The driver must increment the abort count in the **Aborts** member by one every time it encounters an exception other than the IP datagram length being exceeded. This count should include the cases where a packet is not coalesced because of hardware resources.

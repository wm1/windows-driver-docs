# OID\_GEN\_PORT\_STATE


As a query, overlying drivers use the OID\_GEN\_PORT\_STATE OID to get the current state of the port that is specified in the **PortNumber** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows"></a>Windows Vista and later versions of Windows  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Not requested. (see Remarks section)

Remarks
-------

NDIS handles this OID and miniport drivers do not receive this OID query.

If the query succeeds, NDIS returns NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS and returns the port state information in an [**NDIS\_PORT\_STATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566800) structure.

Requirements

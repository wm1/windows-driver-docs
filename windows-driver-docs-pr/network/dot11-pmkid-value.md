**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

The **DOT11\_PMKID\_VALUE** array defines a pairwise master key identifier (PMKID).

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef UCHAR DOT11_PMKID_VALUE[16];
```

**DOT11\_PMKID\_VALUE**  
The PMKID value. For more information about the format of the PMKID value, refer to Clause 8.5.1.2 of the IEEE 802.11i-2004 standard.

An 802.11 station that supports RSNA authentication algorithms uses PMKID values for pre-authentication when it connects to an infrastructure basic service set (BSS) network.

For more information about the PMKID, refer to Clause 8.5.1.2 of the IEEE 802.11i-2004 standard.

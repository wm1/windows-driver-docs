# NDIS\_STATUS\_PORT\_STATE


Miniport drivers that support NDIS ports use the NDIS\_STATUS\_PORT\_STATE status indication to indicate changes in the state of an NDIS port.

Remarks
-------

Miniport drivers must set the port number in the **PortNumber** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure. The **StatusBuffer** member of this structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_PORT\_STATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566800) structure.

Requirements
------------

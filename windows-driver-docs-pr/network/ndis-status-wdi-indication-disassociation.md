# NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_DISASSOCIATION


Miniport drivers use NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_DISASSOCIATION to indicate that a port disconnected from the network.

| Object |
|--------|
| Port   |

 

The disconnect may be triggered by a command from the operating system or triggered from the network. Network triggered disconnect may be explicit from received disassociation or deauthentication packets, or may be implicit when the port cannot detect the presence of the peer it is connected to.

Before the disassociation indication is sent, the port must clear the state associated with this peer. This includes any keys and 802.1x port authorization information associated with this peer. The port must not trigger a roam on its own.

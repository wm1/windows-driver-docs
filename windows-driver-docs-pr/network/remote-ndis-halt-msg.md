# REMOTE\_NDIS\_HALT\_MSG


This message is sent by the host to terminate the network connection. Unlike the other host-initiated control messages, the device does not respond to REMOTE\_NDIS\_HALT\_MSG.

Remarks
-------

It is optional for the device to implement REMOTE\_NDIS\_HALT\_MSG. If implemented, the device sends this message to the host through the control channel only when the device is in a state initialized by Remote NDIS. The device must terminate all communication immediately after sending this message. Sending this message causes the device to enter a state not initialized by Remote NDIS.

All outstanding requests and packets should be discarded on receipt of this message.

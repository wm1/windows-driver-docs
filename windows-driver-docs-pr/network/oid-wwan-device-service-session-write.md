# OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SESSION\_WRITE


OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SESSION\_WRITE directs the miniport driver to write data to the MB device for a device service session.

Query requests are not supported.

Miniport drivers must process set requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending a [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SESSION\_WRITE\_COMPLETE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh846208) status notification containing a [**NDIS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SESSION\_WRITE\_COMPLETE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh831861) structure that describes the completion status of the operation.

Miniport drivers should return NDIS\_STATUS\_ADAPTER\_NOT\_OPEN if the device service session is not open.

# NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED macro


NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED is a macro that NDIS drivers use to access the **ProtocolReserved** member of a [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388) structure.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
PVOID NET_BUFFER_LIST_PROTOCOL_RESERVED(
   PNET_BUFFER_LIST _NBL
);
```

Parameters
----------

*\_NBL*   
A pointer to a NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

Return value
------------

NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED returns a pointer to the start of the **ProtocolReserved** member of the indicated NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

Remarks
-------

Protocol drivers and NDIS intermediate drivers can use **ProtocolReserved** for their own purposes.

**Note**  Only one driver can use **ProtocolReserved** . Therefore, if another driver has used **ProtocolReserved**, an intermediate driver cannot use it.

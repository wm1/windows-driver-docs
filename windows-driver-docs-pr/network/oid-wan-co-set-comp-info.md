# OID\_WAN\_CO\_SET\_COMP\_INFO


The OID\_WAN\_CO\_SET\_COMP\_INFO OID notifies the miniport driver of the PPP compression scheme selected by a protocol to which the miniport driver already returned information with a [OID\_WAN\_CO\_GET\_COMP\_INFO](oid-wan-co-get-comp-info.md) query. This PPP compression scheme is specific to a virtual connection (VC).

The protocol supplies a specification for the PPP compression scheme it selected in an NDIS\_WAN\_CO\_SET\_COMP\_INFO structure, defined as follows:

```ManagedCPlusPlus
    typedef struct _NDIS_WAN_CO_SET_COMP_INFO {
         IN NDIS_WAN_COMPRESS_INFO SendCapabilities;
         IN NDIS_WAN_COMPRESS_INFO RecvCapabilities;
    } NDIS_WAN_CO_SET_COMP_INFO,   *PNDIS_WAN_CO_SET_COMP_INFO;
  
```

## <a href="" id="ddk-oid-wan-co-set-comp-info-nr"></a>


The members of this structure contain the following information:

<a href="" id="sendcapabilities"></a>**SendCapabilities**  
Specifies a structure containing information about compression capabilities for sending data.

<a href="" id="recvcapabilities"></a>**RecvCapabilities**  
Specifies a structure containing information about compression capabilities for receiving data.

Remarks
-------

For specifics of the NDIS\_WAN\_COMPRESS\_INFO structure, see [OID\_WAN\_GET\_COMP\_INFO](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561202).

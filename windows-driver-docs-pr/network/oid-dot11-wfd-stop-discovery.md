# OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_STOP\_DISCOVERY


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_STOP\_DISCOVERY is used to request the Wi-Fi Direct Device to stop any ongoing P2P discovery operation. If a discovery request initiated by Windows is in progress, the Wi-Fi Direct device must complete it by issuing [**NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_WFD\_DISCOVER\_COMPLETE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451704) status indication to Windows.

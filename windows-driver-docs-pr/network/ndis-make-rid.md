# NDIS\_MAKE\_RID macro


The NDIS\_MAKE\_RID macro builds an NDIS\_VF\_RID value from PCI Express (PCIe) segment, bus, device, and function numbers. The miniport driver uses this value as a PCIe Requestor ID (RID) for a network adapter's PCIe Virtual Function (VF).

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
 NDIS_MAKE_RID(
   ULONG _Segment,
   ULONG _Bus,
   ULONG _Function
);
```

Parameters
----------

*\_Segment*   
The PCIe segment number for the group of PCIe buses on which the device is attached. A PCIe segment is a set of PCIe buses that share configuration space.

*\_Bus*   
The PCIe bus number of the bus on which the network adapter is attached.

*\_Function*   
The function number of a logical device on the network adapter.

Return value
------------

NDIS\_MAKE\_RID returns an NDIS\_VF\_RID value that is constructed from the parameters.

Remarks
-------

When it handles an OID request of [OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_ALLOCATE\_VF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451814), the miniport driver for the PCIe Physical Function (PF) uses the NDIS\_MAKE\_RID macro to create a PCIe Requestor ID (RID) value for the VF. The driver retrieves the PCIe segment, bus, device, and function numbers for the VF by calling [**NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451487).

**Note**  If an independent hardware vendor (IHV) provides a virtual bus driver (VBD) as part of its SR-IOV [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840), its PF miniport driver must not call [**NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451487). Instead, the driver must interface with the VBD through a private communication channel, and request that the VBD call [*GetLocation*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451128). This function is exposed from the [GUID\_PCI\_VIRTUALIZATION\_INTERFACE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451143) interface supported by the underlying PCI bus driver.

# OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_START\_GO\_REQUEST


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_START\_GO\_REQUEST object identifier (OID) requests that the Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) Group Owner (GO) start the group. The WFD port should use port configuration information to create beacons, start beaconing, and respond to probe requests.

The miniport behavior for this OID on a WFD GO port is identical to the behavior of an Extensible Access Point port for an [OID\_DOT11\_START\_AP\_REQUEST](oid-dot11-start-ap-request.md) request.

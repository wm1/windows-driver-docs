# OID\_WDI\_TASK\_P2P\_DISCOVER


OID\_WDI\_TASK\_P2P\_DISCOVER is issued to the device to perform Wi-Fi Direct discovery.

| Object | Abort capable                                           | Default priority (host driver policy) | Normal execution time (seconds) |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Port   | Yes. The port must be in a clean state after the abort. | 6                                     | 15                              |

 

The command contains properties which define either a specific set of Wi-Fi Direct devices to search for, or wildcard discovery.

Wi-Fi Direct discovery is mutually exclusive from standard Wi-Fi scanning. While this task is running, broadcast probe requests shall not be sent without a "DIRECT-" SSID, or a specific GO SSID. These probe requests must also include all necessary Wi-Fi Direct IEs.

The host may have search criteria which is not provided as part of the task parameters down to the device. The host may use the task abort mechanism if it has matched the required criteria, therefore it is important that the device can abort Wi-Fi Direct Discovery tasks quickly so as not to degrade scenario performance.

When the task has been completed (either normally or due to an abort), the port should be in a good state such that another discover request can be issued on that port.

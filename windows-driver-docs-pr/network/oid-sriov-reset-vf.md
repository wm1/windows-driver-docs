# OID\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF


Overlying drivers issue an object identifier (OID) set request of OID\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF to reset a specified PCI Express (PCIe) Virtual Function (VF) on a network adapter that supports single root I/O virtualization. Overlying drivers issue this OID set request to the miniport driver of the PCI Express (PCIe) Physical Function (PF) of the network adapter.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451682) structure. The overlying driver specifies the identifier of the VF to be reset through the **VFId** member of this structure.

Remarks
-------

A VF can be reset through a PCI Express (PCIe) Function Level Reset (FLR). Because the FLR request is a privileged operation, it can only be performed by the PF miniport driver that runs in the management operating system of a Hyper-V parent partition. Overlying drivers that run in the management operating system are notified of the FLR request and issue the OID set request of OID\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF to the PF miniport driver.

When it handles this OID request, the PF miniport driver must follow these guidelines:

-   The PF miniport driver must verify that the VF, specified by the **VFId** member of the [**NDIS\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451682) structure, has resources that have been previously allocated. The PF miniport driver allocates resources for a VF during an OID method request of [OID\_NIC\_SWITCH\_ALLOCATE\_VF](oid-nic-switch-allocate-vf.md). If resources for the specified VF have not been allocated, the driver must fail the OID request.

-   The reset operation must only affect the specified VF. The operation must not affect other VFs or the PF on the same network adapter.

### Return Status Codes

The PF miniport driver returns one of the following status codes for the set request of OID\_SRIOV\_RESET\_VF.

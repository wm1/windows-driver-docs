The Wi-Fi Direct port must add these additional IEs to the beacon packets when it is acting as a Group Owner. This is ignored when the Wi-Fi Direct port is operating in device or client mode.                                                                                              |

The Wi-Fi Direct port must add these additional IEs to the probe response packets when it is acting as a Wi-Fi Direct device or Group Owner.

This offset is relative to the start of the buffer that contains this structure. The Wi-Fi Direct port must add these additional IEs to the probe request packets that it transmits. Note that a Wi-Fi Direct discover request may override the default probe request IEs. |

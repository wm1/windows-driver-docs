# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES


Overlying drivers and user-mode applications issue object identifier (OID) query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES to obtain a list of all the receive queues that are allocated on a network adapter.

After a successful return from the OID query request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567205) structure that is followed by an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567204) structure for each filter.

Remarks
-------

NDIS obtained the information from an internal cache of the data that it received from the [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ALLOCATE\_QUEUE](oid-receive-filter-allocate-queue.md) and [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS](oid-receive-filter-queue-parameters.md) OID requests.

Overlying drivers and user-mode applications issue OID query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES to enumerate the receive queues on a network adapter.

If a protocol driver issues the request, the request type inside the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure is set to **NdisRequestQueryInformation** and this OID returns an array of all the receive queues that the protocol driver allocated on the network adapter. If a user-mode application issued the request, the request type inside the **NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST** structure is set to **NdisRequestQueryStatistics**, and this OID returns an array of information for all the receive queues on the network adapter.

### Return Status Codes

NDIS handles the OID query request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The request completed successfully. The <strong>InformationBuffer</strong> points to an [<strong>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_INFO_ARRAY</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567205) structure.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</strong></p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_LENGTH</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The information buffer was too short. NDIS set the <strong>DATA</strong>.<strong>METHOD_INFORMATION</strong>.<strong>BytesNeeded</strong> member in the [<strong>NDIS_OID_REQUEST</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure to the minimum buffer size that is required.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>NDIS_STATUS_FAILURE</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The request failed for other reasons.</p></td>

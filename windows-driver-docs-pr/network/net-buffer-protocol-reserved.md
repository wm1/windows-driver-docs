# NET\_BUFFER\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED macro


NET\_BUFFER\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED is a macro that NDIS drivers use to get the **ProtocolReserved** member of a [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376) structure.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
PVOID NET_BUFFER_PROTOCOL_RESERVED(
   PNET_BUFFER _NB
);
```

Parameters
----------

*\_NB*   
A pointer to a NET\_BUFFER structure.

Return value
------------

NET\_BUFFER\_PROTOCOL\_RESERVED returns the value of the **ProtocolReserved** member of the specified NET\_BUFFER structure.

Remarks
-------

Protocol drivers and NDIS intermediate drivers can use this area for their own purposes. Protocol drivers typically use **ProtocolReserved** to maintain [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376) structure context information for outstanding transfers.

**Note**  Only one driver can use **ProtocolReserved** . Therefore, if an another driver has used **ProtocolReserved**, an intermediate driver cannot use it.

# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS


An overlying driver issues an OID method request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS to obtain a list of all the filters that are configured on a network adapter.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure.

After a successful return from the OID method request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to a buffer. This buffer is formatted to contain the following:

-   An [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure that specifies a list of receive filters that are currently configured on a miniport driver.

-   An array of [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567176) structures. Each structure specifies the parameters of a receive filter that is currently configured on a miniport driver.

Remarks
-------

NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:

-   [NDIS Packet Coalescing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451601). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Managing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh464026).

-   [Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh440235). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting a Receive Filter on a Virtual Port](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh440224).

-   [Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571035). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting and Clearing VMQ Filters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570780).

Overlying drivers or applications issue OID method requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS to enumerate the receive filters that were set on a network adapter. This includes receive filters that were set on an SR-IOV virtual port (VPort) or a VMQ receive queue.

### Additional Guidelines for the NDIS Packet Coalescing Interface

Starting with Windows Server 2012, NDIS packet coalescing only supports the default receive queue of a network adapter.

To enumerate the packet coalescing receive filters, the overlying driver must set the **QueueId** member of the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure to NDIS\_DEFAULT\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_ID.

### Additional Guidelines for the SR-IOV Interface

Starting with Windows Server 2012, the SR-IOV interface only supports the default receive queue of a virtual port (VPort).

To enumerate the VPort receive filters, the overlying driver must set the **QueueId** member of the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure to NDIS\_DEFAULT\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_ID.

### Additional Guidelines for the VMQ Interface

An overlying driver can issue OID method requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS to enumerate the receive filters that were set on a VMQ receive queue. When the overlying driver initializes the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure, it sets the **QueueId** member to one of the following values:

-   The queue identifier value for a nondefault receive queue. The overlying driver obtained the queue identifier input value from an earlier OID method request of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ALLOCATE\_QUEUE](oid-receive-filter-allocate-queue.md) or an OID query request of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES](oid-receive-filter-enum-queues.md).

-   The queue identifier value of NDIS\_DEFAULT\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_ID, which specifies the default receive queue.

### Return status codes

NDIS handles the OID method request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes:

<a href="" id="ndis-status-success"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS  
The request completed successfully. The **InformationBuffer** points to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_INFO\_ARRAY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567179) structure.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-pending"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_PENDING  
The request is pending completion. NDIS passes the final status code and results to the OID request completion handler of the caller after the request has completed.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-invalid-length"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_LENGTH  
The information buffer was too short. NDIS set the **DATA.QUERY\_INFORMATION.BytesNeeded** member in the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure to the minimum buffer size that is required.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-failure"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_FAILURE  
The request failed for other reasons.

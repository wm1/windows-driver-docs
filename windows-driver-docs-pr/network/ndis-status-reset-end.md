# NDIS\_STATUS\_RESET\_END


The NDIS\_STATUS\_RESET\_END status indicates that a miniport adapter reset operation is complete.

Remarks
-------

Miniport drivers should not call the [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) function to signal the start and finish of each reset operation because NDIS notifies overlying drivers when a reset operation begins and ends.

When a miniport driver starts a reset operation, NDIS notifies the overlying drivers with an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_RESET\_START**](ndis-status-reset-start.md) status indication.

After a bound protocol driver receives an NDIS\_STATUS\_RESET\_END status indication, the protocol driver can resume sending data and making OID requests.

After an overlying filter or intermediate driver receives an NDIS\_STATUS\_RESET\_END status indication, the driver can resume sending data and making OID requests to overlying drivers.

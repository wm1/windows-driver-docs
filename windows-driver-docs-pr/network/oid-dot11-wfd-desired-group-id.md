# OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_DESIRED\_GROUP\_ID


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_DESIRED\_GROUP\_ID object identifier (OID) sets WFD group identifier that the miniport should use when starting as the WFD Group Owner (GO).

The data type for this OID is the **DOT11\_WFD\_GROUP\_ID** structure.

```ManagedCPlusPlus
    typedef struct _DOT11_WFD_GROUP_ID 
    {
        DOT11_MAC_ADDRESS DeviceAddress;
        DOT11_SSID SSID;    
    } DOT11_WFD_GROUP_ID, * PDOT11_WFD_GROUP_ID;
  
```

This structure includes the following members:

<a href="" id="deviceaddress"></a>**DeviceAddress**  
The address of the device that will become the GO.

<a href="" id="--------ssid"></a> **SSID**  
The SSID for the GO device.

The identifier is used to configure the group when an [OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_START\_GO\_REQUEST](oid-dot11-wfd-start-go-request.md) OID is received.

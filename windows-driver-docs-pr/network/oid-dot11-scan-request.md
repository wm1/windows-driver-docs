# OID\_DOT11\_SCAN\_REQUEST


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_SCAN\_REQUEST object identifier (OID) requests that the 802.11 station perform a survey of all basic service set (BSS) networks within range of the NIC's radio. The 802.11 station performs the scan operation by using the parameters defined in the set request.

The data type for this OID is the [**DOT11\_SCAN\_REQUEST\_V2**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548767) structure.

When OID\_DOT11\_SCAN\_REQUEST is set, the miniport driver must fail the set request under the following conditions by returning the specified value from its [*MiniportOidRequest*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559416) function.

When performing the scan operation, the miniport driver and 802.11 station must follow the guidelines described in [Native 802.11 Scan Operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560679). The miniport driver must not wait for the scan operation to finish before completing the set request. The driver must return NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS from its [*MiniportOidRequest*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559416) function after initiating the scan operation.

If the miniport driver supports the functionality of multiple MAC entities through [virtualization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571041), the driver should not return NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_MEDIA\_IN\_USE if the medium is blocked by another MAC.

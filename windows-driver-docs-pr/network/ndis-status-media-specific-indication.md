# NDIS\_STATUS\_MEDIA\_SPECIFIC\_INDICATION


The NDIS\_STATUS\_MEDIA\_SPECIFIC\_INDICATION status indicates a media-specific status.

Remarks
-------

Miniport drivers make media-specific status indications by calling the [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) function with the **StatusCode** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure set to NDIS\_STATUS\_MEDIA\_SPECIFIC\_INDICATION. The **StatusBuffer** member of this structure points to a driver-allocated buffer. The buffer contains data in a format that is specific to the status indication that is identified in the **StatusCode** member.

Requirements

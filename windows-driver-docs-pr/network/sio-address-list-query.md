# SIO\_ADDRESS\_LIST\_QUERY


The SIO\_ADDRESS\_LIST\_QUERY socket I/O control operation allows a WSK application to query the current list of local transport addresses for a socket's address family. This socket I/O control operation applies to all socket types.

To query the current list of local transport addresses for a socket's address family, a WSK application calls the [**WskControlSocket**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571127) function with the following parameters.

A WSK application does not specify a pointer to an IRP when calling the **WskControlSocket** function to query the current list of local transport addresses for a socket's address family.

If the call to the **WskControlSocket** function succeeds, the output buffer contains a [**SOCKET\_ADDRESS\_LIST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570826) structure followed by the SOCKADDR structures for each of the local transport addresses for the socket's address family.

If the **WskControlSocket** function returns STATUS\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW, the variable that is pointed to by the *OutputSizeReturned* parameter contains the output buffer size, in bytes, that is required to contain the complete list of local transport addresses for the socket's address family.

The [**SIO\_ADDRESS\_LIST\_CHANGE**](sio-address-list-change.md) socket I/O control operation allows a WSK application to be notified when there has been a change to the list of local transport addresses for a socket's address family.

# NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

A miniport driver must make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION status indication after the following events:

-   The NIC successfully sends an association response frame to a peer station on an infrastructure BSS that originally sent an association request.

-   The association is successful and the NIC successfully sends the corresponding association response frame to the peer station that originally requested the association.

-   The association fails, regardless of whether the response is sent successfully or not. The failure can be because the NIC or operating system reject the association request or because of a failure not related to the 802.11 framework.

The data type for this indication is the [**DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548650) structure.

The NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION status indication marks the end of an *association indication block*, which denotes the time between NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_STARTED and NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION indications when a NIC is operating in ExtAP OP mode. Every NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_STARTED indication made by the driver must have a corresponding NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION indication.

A peer station cannot have multiple overlapping incoming association indication blocks. Incoming association indication blocks for different peer stations can overlap.

The miniport driver calls [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563600) to make an NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION indication, and must pass a pointer to an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure through the *StatusIndication* parameter. When the driver makes this indication, it must set the following members of the NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION structure:

-   **StatusCode** must be set to NDIS\_STATUS\_DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION.\]

-   **StatusBuffer** must be set to the address of a DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION\_PARAMETERS structure.

-   **StatusBufferSize** must be set to sizeof(DOT11\_INCOMING\_ASSOC\_COMPLETION\_PARAMETERS).

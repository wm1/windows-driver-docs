# OID\_QOS\_HARDWARE\_CAPABILITIES


An overlying driver issues an object identifier (OID) query request of OID\_QOS\_HARDWARE\_CAPABILITIES to obtain the NDIS Quality of Service (QoS) hardware capabilities of a network adapter.

After a successful return from the OID query request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566710) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_QOS\_CAPABILITIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451629) structure.

**Note**  This OID query request is handled by NDIS for miniport drivers that support the IEEE 802.1 Data Center Bridging (DCB) interface.

 

Remarks
-------

The [**NDIS\_QOS\_CAPABILITIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451629) structure contains information about the NDIS QoS hardware capabilities of a network adapter. These capabilities can include hardware capabilities that are currently disabled by INF file settings or through the **Advanced** properties page.

**Note**  All the NDIS QoS hardware capabilities of a network adapter are returned through an OID query request of OID\_QOS\_HARDWARE\_CAPABILITIES, regardless of whether a capability is enabled or disabled.

 

Miniport drivers registers the NDIS QoS hardware capabilities of a network adapter when its [*MiniportInitializeEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559389) function is called. The driver registers these capabilities by following these steps:

1.  The driver initializes an [**NDIS\_QOS\_CAPABILITIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451629) structure with the NDIS QoS hardware capabilities.

2.  The driver sets the **HardwareQosCapabilities** member of the [**NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_HARDWARE\_ASSIST\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565924) structure to a pointer to the [**NDIS\_QOS\_CAPABILITIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451629) structure.

3.  The miniport driver then calls the [**NdisMSetMiniportAttributes**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563672) function and sets the *MiniportAttributes* parameter to a pointer to an [**NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_HARDWARE\_ASSIST\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565924) structure.

**Note**  NDIS does not report the NDIS QoS hardware capabilities of a network adapter to overlying protocol and filter drivers during the bind or attach operations.

 

For more information on how to register NDIS QoS capabilities, see [Registering NDIS QoS Capabilities](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh440188).

### Return Status Codes

NDIS handles the OID query request of OID\_QOS\_HARDWARE\_CAPABILITIES request for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes.

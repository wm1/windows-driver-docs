# OID\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_MULTICARRIER\_PROVIDERS


OID\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_MULTICARRIER\_PROVIDERS is used to *set* or *query* the list of preferred multi-carrier network providers. Multi-carrier providers are ones that can be *set* as home providers.

Both *set* and *query* requests are supported. Miniport drivers must process *set* and *query* requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending a [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_MULTICARRIER\_PROVIDERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh846211) status notification containing an [**NDIS\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_MULTICARRIER\_PROVIDERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh831864) structure.

Miniport drivers should set the **PreferredListHeader.ElementType** member to **WwanStructProvider2** and the **PreferredListHeader.ElementCount** member to the number of providers in the list when responding to OID\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_PROVIDERS *query* requests. The multi-carrier providers returned in a *query* must be able to be set as the home provider at the time the preferred multi-carrier list is returned to the service.

Miniport drivers should set the **PreferredListHeader.ElementType** member to **WwanStructProvider2** and the **PreferredListHeader.ElementCount** member to 0 when responding to OID\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_PROVIDERS *set* requests.

On error miniports should set the **uStatus** member of NDIS\_WWAN\_PREFERRED\_MULTICARRIER\_PROVIDERS structure with the failure status and **PreferredListHeader.ElementCount** to 0 and **PreferredLIstHeader.ElementType** to **WwanStructProvider2**.

The **Rssi** and **ErrorRate** members of WWAN\_PROVIDER2 structure should be set if available.

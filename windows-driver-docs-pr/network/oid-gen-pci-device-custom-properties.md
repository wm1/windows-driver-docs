# OID\_GEN\_PCI\_DEVICE\_CUSTOM\_PROPERTIES


As a query, overlying drivers use the OID\_GEN\_PCI\_DEVICE\_CUSTOM\_PROPERTIES OID to get the PCI custom properties of a device.

Remarks
-------

NDIS handles OID\_GEN\_PCI\_DEVICE\_CUSTOM\_PROPERTIES and miniport drivers do not receive an OID query.

This query is optional for other NDIS drivers.

NDIS returns an [**NDIS\_PCI\_DEVICE\_CUSTOM\_PROPERTIES**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566745) structure that contains the PCI custom properties.

For non-PCI miniport adapters, NDIS fails OID\_GEN\_PCI\_DEVICE\_CUSTOM\_PROPERTIES with the NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_DEVICE\_REQUEST status code.

Requirements
------------

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Version</p></td>
<td><p>Supported in NDIS 6.0 and later.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Header</p></td>
<td>Ntddndis.h (include Ndis.h)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO


OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO sets or returns the device-slot mappings of the MB device (i.e. the executor-slot mappings).

Miniport drivers must process query requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request before later sending an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt782397) status notification containing an [**NDIS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt782403) structure to provide information on the executor-to-slot mappings.

The following diagram illustrates a query request.

Miniport drivers must process set requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request before later sending an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt782397) status notification containing an [**NDIS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt782403) structure, which in turn contains a [**WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt799890) structure to indicate the current mapping status. This holds true even if the set request failed. The structure for set requests for OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO is [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SET\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt782405).

The following diagram illustrates a set request.

Remarks
-------

The host expects that on first boot, the modem would have a default mapping between slots and executors. The host performs a SET operation with OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SLOT\_MAPPING\_INFO to define the slot that is bound to each executor. The host expects the modem to maintain the mapping across reboots and removals/insertions. This OID is not executor-specific and may be sent to any NDIS instance on the device. It may also query the current mapping as shown above.

# OID\_DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_SUPPORTED


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When queried, the OID\_DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_SUPPORTED object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver return the value of the IEEE 802.11 **dot11CCAModeSupported** management information base (MIB) object for the current PHY type on the 802.11 station.

This MIB object specifies the types of clear channel assessment (CCA) modes supported by the current PHY type. For more information about CCA, refer to Clause 16.4.8.5 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard and Clause 18.4.8.4 of the IEEE 802.11b-1999 standard.

The data type for OID\_DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_SUPPORTED is a ULONG value, which defines the supported CCA modes through the following bitmask:

<a href="" id="dot11-cca-mode-ed-only--0x00000001-"></a>DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_ED\_ONLY (0x00000001)  
Only CCA mode using the energy detect (ED) signal is supported. For more information about the ED signal, refer to Clause 15.4.6.1 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

<a href="" id="dot11-cca-mode-cs-only--0x00000002-"></a>DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_CS\_ONLY (0x00000002)  
Only CCA mode using the carrier sense (CS) signal is supported. For more information about the CS signal, refer to Clause 15.4.6.2 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

<a href="" id="dot11-cca-mode-ed-and-cs--0x00000004-"></a>DOT11\_CCA\_MODE\_ED\_and\_CS (0x00000004)  
Both ED and CS modes are supported.

The **dot11CCAModeSupported** MIB object is only valid for the following PHY types:

-   Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) PHY.

-   High-rate DSSS (HRDSSS) PHY.

-   Extended-rate PHY (ERP).

If the current PHY type is not set to **dot11\_phy\_type\_dsss**, **dot11\_phy\_type\_hrdsss**, or **dot11\_phy\_type\_erp**, the miniport driver must fail the query request by returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_DATA from its [*MiniportOidRequest*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559416) function.

If the miniport driver is operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode, the current PHY type is determined through the ExtSTA **msDot11CurrentPhyID** MIB object. This MIB object specifies the index of the current PHY type within the 802.11 station's list of supported PHY types. For more information about this MIB object, see [OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_PHY\_ID](oid-dot11-current-phy-id.md).

**Note**  A Native 802.11 miniport driver that is designed to run on the Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 operating systems must always reset this 802.11 MIB OID to its default value. This is the case regardless of the value of the **bSetDefaultMIB** member of the DOT11\_RESET\_REQUEST structure. This requirement applies to a miniport driver that, in a call to the **NdisMSetMiniportAttributes** function, sets **MiniportAttributes** -&gt; **Native\_802\_11\_Attributes** -&gt; **Header** -&gt; **Revision** to NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_802\_11\_ATTRIBUTES\_REVISION\_1.

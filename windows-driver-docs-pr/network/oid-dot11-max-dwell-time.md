# OID\_DOT11\_MAX\_DWELL\_TIME


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When queried, the OID\_DOT11\_MAX\_DWELL\_TIME object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver return the value of the IEEE 802.11 **dot11MaxDwellTime** management information base (MIB) object for the current PHY type on the 802.11 station.

The **dot11MaxDwellTime** MIB object defines the maximum time that the current PHY type operates on a single channel when the 802.11 station is transmitting data.

**Note**  Support for OID\_DOT11\_MAX\_DWELL\_TIME is mandatory if the NIC supports the **dot11\_phy\_type\_fhss** PHY type. For more information about how the miniport driver specifies its list of supported PHY types, see [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_PHY\_TYPES](oid-dot11-supported-phy-types.md).

 

The data type for OID\_DOT11\_MAX\_DWELL\_TIME is a ULONG value that specifies the maximum dwell time in units of 802.11 time units (TU). One TU is 1024 microseconds. The value of the **dot11MaxDwellTime** MIB must be from 1 through 65535.

The **dot11MaxDwellTime** MIB object is valid for only the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) PHY type. If the current PHY type is not set to **dot11\_phy\_type\_fhss**, the miniport driver must fail the query request by returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_DATA from its [*MiniportOidRequest*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559416) function.

If the miniport driver is operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode, the current PHY type is determined through the ExtSTA **msDot11CurrentPhyID** MIB object. This MIB object specifies the index of the current PHY type within the 802.11 station's list of supported PHY types. For more information about **msDot11CurrentPhyID**, see [OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_PHY\_ID](oid-dot11-current-phy-id.md).

**Note**  A Native 802.11 miniport driver that is designed to run on the Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 operating systems must always reset this 802.11 MIB OID to its default value. This is the case regardless of the value of the **bSetDefaultMIB** member of the DOT11\_RESET\_REQUEST structure. This requirement applies to a miniport driver that, in a call to the **NdisMSetMiniportAttributes** function, sets **MiniportAttributes** -&gt; **Native\_802\_11\_Attributes** -&gt; **Header** -&gt; **Revision** to NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_802\_11\_ATTRIBUTES\_REVISION\_1.

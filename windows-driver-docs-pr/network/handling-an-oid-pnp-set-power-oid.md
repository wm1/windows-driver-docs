# Handling an OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER OID


## <a href="" id="ddk-handling-an-oid-pnp-set-power-oid-ng"></a>


NDIS sends an OID request of [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569780) to notify a miniport driver that a network adapter will be making a transition from the working state to a sleeping state or from a sleeping state to the working state. An OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request can be preceded by an [OID\_PNP\_QUERY\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569778) request.

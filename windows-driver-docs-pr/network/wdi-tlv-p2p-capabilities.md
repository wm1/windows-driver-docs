# WDI\_TLV\_P2P\_CAPABILITIES


WDI\_TLV\_P2P\_CAPABILITIES is a TLV that contains Wi-Fi Direct capabilities.

## TLV Type


0x17

## Length


The sum (in bytes) of the sizes of all contained elements.

## Values

<tr class="odd">

<td>Specifies the maximum supported number of Service Name Advertisements bytes (to be sent in the beacon and probe responses). This sets a hard limit on the number of services that can be advertised.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>UINT32</td>
<td>Specifies the maximum supported number of Service Information Advertisement bytes the adapter can respond to using the GAS protocol. This is only valid if the device supports responding to Service Advertisement queries. This value is for firmware optimization so that the firmware does not wake up the host to respond to every query. The operating system does not limit the number of service advertisements if the firmware has a limitation because there is a fallback in the operating system. If the firmware cannot handle the ANQP query response, it should pass up the request and the operating system handles it.</td>

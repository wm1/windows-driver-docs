# Security


Use the topics in this section to learn more about security in Windows 10 Mobile.

## OS security tasks


To create a secure device, the OEM should complete the following tasks.

## <a href="" id="sdl"></a>SDL recommendations for OEMs


The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a set of best practices and associated tools that OEMs can use to improve the security of their products. SDL practices are organized by the phases of the traditional software development life cycle in which they are most effective. For example, threat modeling is most effective during software design.

Many of these security activities would provide some degree of security benefit if implemented on a standalone basis. However, practical experience at Microsoft has shown that security activities executed in chronological order during the right phase of the software development life cycle and as part of a repeatable process can result in greater security gains than those resulting from ad-hoc implementation. For more info about the SDL, see [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=190289).

The following table describes a subset of the SDL practices that are most useful for the OEM to adopt. Some of these practices are more helpful for driver code, while others are more helpful for application code. Some of the SDL practices are useful for both. Drivers tend to run with higher privileges, so it is important to consider these best practices when developing driver code.

<td><p>The BinScope Binary Analyzer is a verification tool that analyzes binaries to ensure that they have been built in compliance with the SDL requirements and recommendations. BinScope checks that SDL-required compiler/linker flags are being set, strong-named assemblies are in use, up-to-date build tools are in place, and the latest good ATL headers are being used. BinScope also reports on dangerous constructs that are prohibited by SDL.</p></td>

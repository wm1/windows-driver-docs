# ESRT table definition


The pointer to the ESRT table is identified via its corresponding GUID in the EFI\_CONFIGURATION\_TABLE.

``` syntax
#define EFI_SYSTEM_RESOURCE_TABLE_GUID   \
{ 0xb122a263, 0x3661, 0x4f68,  0x99, 0x29, 0x78, 0xf8, 0xb0, 0xd6, 0x21, 0x80  }
```

The following table describes the format of the ESRT table and the firmware resource entries contained in the table.

Core UEFI firmware should allocate and populate an ESRT configuration table containing one system resource entry for itself (system firmware). For illustrative purposes, in this guide core firmware will also create one additional entry representing a device that supports device firmware update using the firmware update package mechanism.

There must always be exactly one entry describing system firmware. This entry is used to target a system firmware update. If an implementation performs system and device firmware updates as a single, monolithic operation, the system firmware entry must be used to target the update. In all other cases, device firmware updates are targeted by an ESRT entry describing device firmware.

The first step then is to generate GUIDs to represent these two firmware resources, i.e., {SYSTEM\_FIRMWARE} and {DEVICE\_FIRMWARE}. Table 2 shows an example of a table definition. This example assumes both firmware versions are currently version 1 (Firmware Version == 1).

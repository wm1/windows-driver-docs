# \#Endif Conditional Preprocessor Directive


```
#Endif:
```

The \#Endif directive defines the end of the previous section and the conditional construct. No symbol is used. You can use a fake symbol name as the value of the \#Endif directive to help the reader. Consider the following code example.

```
    #Ifdef: symbolA

        #Ifdef: symbolB

        #Elseifdef: symbolD

        #Endif: symbolB

    #Endif: symbolA
```

Indentation of each nested construct might also be helpful to the reader.

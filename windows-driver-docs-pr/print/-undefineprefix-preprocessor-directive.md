# \#UndefinePrefix Preprocessor Directive


```
#UndefinePrefix:
```

The \#UndefinePrefix directive deletes the current prefix. The previously defined prefix becomes the current prefix. Only prefixes that you define by using the [\#SetPPPrefix](-setppprefix-preprocessor-directive.md) directive can be undefined. The system default prefix cannot be undefined. This directive does not use a symbol.

This preprocessor prefix is new for GDL.

# Testing USB hardware, drivers, and apps in Windows


This section describes tools that you can use to test your USB hardware or software, capture traces of operations and other system events, and observe how the USB driver stack responds to a request sent by a client driver or an application.

<td><p>The Microsoft USB Test Tool (MUTT) is collection of devices for testing interoperability of your USB hardware with the Microsoft USB driver stack. This section provides a brief overview of the different types of MUTT devices, the tests you can run by using the device, and suggests topologies for controller, hub, device, and BIOS/UEFI testing.</p>
<p>To communicate with MUTT devices, you need the MUTT software package. This package contains several test tools and drivers that let hardware test engineers test interoperability of their USB controller or hub with the Microsoft USB driver stack. The test tools validate USB host controller software, hardware (including firmware) and any USB hub that is installed between the host controller and the device.</p></td>

It provides guidelines for device and system manufacturers to perform various functional and stress tests on systems and devices that expose a USB Type-C connector. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the official USB specification and xHCI interoperability test procedures, which can be downloaded from USB.ORG.</p></td>

<td><p>Read how to run stress and transfer and Super MUTT performance tests.</p>
<p>Stress and transfer tests are geared towards saturating the bus protocol and the host controller software. These tests perform several simultaneous I/O transfers and cancellations to the MUTT device. The MUTT firmware is programmed to fail transfers during these tests. These failures emulate error conditions that the controller or USB driver stack are exposed to under stressful USB conditions.</p></td>

<td><p>Describes the Device Fundamental tests that you must run for MUTT devices that are attached to available ports, to perform stress and transfer tests and system power tests.</p>
<p>These tests perform simple device transfers at the same time that they perform system power events. Note that devfund tests can only be run on Windows 8. You cannot [run stress and transfer tests](how-to-run-stress-and-transfer-and-super-mutt-performance-tests-for-mutt-devices.md) and the system power tests simultaneously. Perform those tests on separate systems. However, you can switch between stress transfer and system power tests. To do so, complete the first set of tests, reboot the machine, and then follow the instructions of the next test.</p></td>

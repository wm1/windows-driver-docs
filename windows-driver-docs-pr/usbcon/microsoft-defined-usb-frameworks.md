# Microsoft-Defined USB Driver Frameworks


This topic describes the Microsoft-provided driver framework for USB devices that do not have their own USB device class specification.

Microsoft provides a driver framework for some types of USB devices that do not have their own USB device class specification. Vendors who want to develop these types of devices should develop a device driver that uses the specified framework for the device type.

Currently Microsoft provides the following driver frameworks for the following USB devices:

-   USB biometric devices

    Microsoft supports USB biometric devices (fingerprint readers) by providing the Windows Biometric Framework. For more information please see the [Windows Biometric Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/biometric/default.mspx) website.

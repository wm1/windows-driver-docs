# Content Security Features in Usbccgp.sys


Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems often make use of device serial numbers to ensure that legitimate customers have access to digitized intellectual property. If a USB device has a CSM-1 content security interface, a client driver can query for its serial number by sending an [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_GET\_MEDIA\_SERIAL\_NUMBER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560557) request to the generic parent driver.

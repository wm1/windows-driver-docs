This topic explains how to test the interoperability of USB Type-C enabled systems and Windows. It provides guidelines for device and system manufacturers to perform various functional and stress tests on systems and devices that expose a USB Type-C connector. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the official USB specification and xHCI interoperability test procedures, which can be downloaded from USB.ORG.

To run these tests by using the USB Type-C ConnEx board, see [Test USB Type-C systems with USB Type-C ConnEx](test-usb-type-c-systems-with-mutt-connex-c.md).

The test product can belong to one or more of the following categories:

-   **System**: Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones with an exposed Type-C USB port. The system must be running a version of Windows 10, such as Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education), Windows 10 Mobile, or other versions.
-   **Dock**: Any USB Type-C device that exposes more than one port.
-   **Device**: Any USB device with a Type-C port that can be attached to a system or dock. This category includes traditional USB devices as well as devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

The USB Type-C interoperability test procedures are divided into two sections: functional testing (FT) and stress testing (ST). Each test section describes the test case and identifies the category that applies to the test. The product must be tested against the entire applicable category. Certain test cases contain links to relevant hints and tips for additional information. This document is focused on USB Type-C functionality and experience. A USB Type-C solution may contains other USB components such as a USB hub or USB controller. Detailed testing of USB hubs and controllers is covered in both the USB-IF's [xHCI interoperability test procedures](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623257) and the Windows Hardware Certification Kit.

<!-- -->

-   Perform all function stress test cases. Suggested configuration for the USB Type-C A/V is shown in this image:

    ![usb type-c a/v adapter configuration](images/typec3.png)

## <a href="" id="add"></a>How to confirm device addition


-   Identify the USB host controller to which your device is connected.
-   Make sure that the new device appears under the correct node in **Device Manager**.
-   For USB 3.0 hubs connected to a USB 3.0 port, expect to see two devices: one downstream of the USB 3.0 and another downstream of the full speed hub.

## <a href="" id="remove"></a>How to confirm device removal


-   Identify your device in **Device Manager**.
-   Perform the test step to remove the device from the system.
-   Confirm that the device is no longer present in **Device Manager**.
-   For a USB 3.0 hub, check that both devices (SuperSpeed and companion hubs) are removed. Failure to remove a device in this case may be a device failure and should be investigated by all components involved to triage the appropriate root cause.

## <a href="" id="function"></a>How to confirm device functionality


-   If the device is a USB hub, make sure that the devices that are downstream of the hub are functional. Verify that other devices can be connected to available ports on the hub.
-   If the device is an HID device, test its functionality. Make sure that a USB keyboard types, a USB mouse moves the cursor, and a gaming device is functional in the game controller's control panel.
-   A USB audio device must play and/or record sound.
-   A storage device must be accessible and should be able to copy a file 200MB or more in size.
-   If the device has multiple functions, such as scan & print, make sure to test both the scan and print functionality.
-   If the device is a USB Type-C, confirm applicable USB and alternate modes are functional.

## <a href="" id="connect"></a>How to connect a device to a System


-   Make sure that USB 3.x devices use a USB 3.x cable appropriate to the test device.
-   If the device is not recognized by the system, attempt to connect the device with a different cable of the same type to check for bad cables or connectors.

## <a href="" id="wake"></a>Troubleshooting system wake


To troubleshoot a device that is not able to wake up the system:

-   Confirm that the device is wake-up capable.
-   Confirm that the host controller, to which the device is attached, is set up to wake the system.

## Troubleshooting missing power states


If your test system is unable to reach a Sleep or Hibernate state, make sure that all devices in the system have the latest device drivers installed. One of the most common causes is an unsupported video card in the system. For more information about resolving system power state issues, see [Why isn't Sleep available?]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623315).

## Using ETW to log issues


To enable ETW for USB 2.0 ports, see [ETW in the Windows 7 USB core stack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623316).

To enable USB 3.0 logging, perform the following commands instead (or see [How to capture a USB event trace with Logman](how-to-capture-a-usb-event-trace.md)):

``` syntax
logman start usbtrace -ets -o usbtrace.etl -nb 128 640 -bs 128
logman update usbtrace -ets -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-UCX Default
logman update usbtrace -ets -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-USBHUB3 Default
```

After these are logs are captured, perform the test scenario.

Stop the trace by using this command:

``` syntax
logman stop usbtrace -ets
```

## <a href="" id="analyzer"></a>Using an Analyzer to confirm Selective Suspend


To analyze USB 2.0 and 3.0 traffic, you will need a USB Analyzer device such as the LeCroy Voyager M3i, Advisor T3, or a TotalPhase Beagle 5000. These analyzers are capable of capturing and displaying link state information necessary to confirm selective suspend functionality.

For example, after capturing traffic with a TotalPhase analyzer, you will see an event similar to the following in the output:

![usb type-c analyzer](images/typec-analyzer.png)

When a test requires the device to go to a suspended state, you should be able to correlate the &lt;Suspend&gt; event above with the time at which you expected the device to go to the suspend state.

## Using an Analyzer to confirm LPM U1 and U2 transitions


An analyzer trace should explicitly show every link state transition: statements appear as "Rx U0 -&gt; U2" in the events. For example, by using LeCroy software, in the **Report** tab, select the **USB3 Link State Timing View**. This option shows the link state on a time axis. Note that at times the analyzer might not show the U1 to U2 transition correctly. You might see the link state going into U1 but recovering back from U2.

## Disabling Selective Suspend in Device Manager


In order to disable selective suspend on a USB device in Device Manager, first find the device node in the device tree. In this example, disable selective suspend on the hub shown below:

![device manager](images/typec-device-mgr.png)

Right-click the device and select **Properties**. Then select the **Power Management** tab.

![device manager](images/typec-device-mgr1.png)

To disable selective suspend, make sure the **Allow the computer to turn off this device** to save power checkbox is clear.

## <a href="" id="flip"></a>Flipping or reversing the USB Type-C cable


The USB Type-C cable is intended to maintain user functionality regardless of cable orientation. Flipping or reversing the cable is achieved by removing cable, rotating it 180 degrees and reinserting the cable.

## Reporting test results


Provide these details:

-   The list of tests (in order) that were performed before the failed test.
-   The list must specify the tests that have failed or passed.
-   Systems, devices, docks, or hubs that were used for the tests. Include make, model, and Web site so that we can get additional information, if needed.

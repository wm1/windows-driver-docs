# Troubleshoot messages for a USB Type-C Windows system


Possible causes and resolutions to troubleshooting messages in Windows 10 that users might get on USB Type-C systems running Windows.

The symmetric and reversible design of the USB Type-C connector allows users to connect systems running Windows to connect any USB Type-C device, and use new features such as enhanced charging and alternate modes. However, certain combinations of hardware and/or software limitations might prevent some of these features from functioning properly. Windows 10 provides a set of USB Type-C notifications to help users troubleshoot these issues.

In this topic, a USB Type-C system refers to a PC running Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) or a mobile device running Windows 10 Mobile.

<li>The charger is not compatible with your system.
<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>  Non-USB Type-C chargers support the USB Battery Charging 1.2 specification. Some of these chargers use proprietary charging mechanisms. Your system might not support all those chargers.
</div>
<div>
 
</div></li>
<li>The charger is not powerful enough to charge the system.</li>
<li>The charger is not connected to a charging port of the system.</li>
<li>The charging cable does not meet the power requirement of the charger or the system.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>  
<p>A system with USB Type-C connectors has higher power limits, it can support up to 5V, 3A, 15W. If the connector supports [USB Power Delivery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=623310) (industry standard), it can charge faster at higher power levels.</p>
<p>In order for you to get the fast charging benefits, your system, charger, and cable must support the industry standards. In addition, your charger and cable must support the power levels required by the system to optimally charge it. For example, if your system requires 12V and 3A for charging, a 5V, 3A charger cannot charge your system optimally.</p>

<p>USB Type-C introduces a new feature called alternate modes, which allows non-USB protocols to run over the USB Type-C cable. For example, a dock that uses alternate modes has the ability to transmit a video signal over USB.</p>
<p>In order for an alternate mode to work, the hardware and the software on the PC/phone and the device or adapter must support the alternate mode. In addition, certain alternate modes may require specific USB Type-C cables.</p></td>

</ul>
<p>USB Type-C introduces a new feature called alternate modes. The feature allows non-USB protocols to run over the USB Type-C cable, while simultaneously preserving USB 2.0 and charging functionality. Here are the display alternate modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DisplayPort</strong> /<strong>DockPort</strong></p>
<p>This alternate mode allows the user to project audio/video to external DisplayPort displays over a USB connector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MHL</strong></p>
<p>The MHL alternate mode is allows the user to project video/audio to external displays that support MHL.</p></li>

<p>The hardware and software on the system, the device or adapter, or cable does not support the <strong>DisplayPort</strong> /<strong>DockPort</strong> or <strong>MHL</strong> alternate modes.</p></td>

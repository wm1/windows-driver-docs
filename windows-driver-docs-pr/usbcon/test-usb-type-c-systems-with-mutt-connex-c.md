The MUTT Connection Exerciser Type-C (USB Type-C ConnEx) hardware board is a custom shield for the Arduino board. The shield provides a four-to-one switch to automate interoperability tests for USB Type-C scenarios.

This topic provides guidelines to automate the testing of systems, devices, docks with USB Type-C connectors and their interoperability with the Windows operating system. You can test hardware that belong to one of the following categories:

-   System: Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones running a SKU of a version of the Windows operating system with an exposed USB Type-C port.
-   Dock: Any USB Type-C device that exposes more than one port.
-   Device: Any USB device with a Type-C port that can be attached to a system or dock. This category includes traditional USB devices as well as devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

## Hardware requirements


To perform the USB Type-C interoperability test procedures by using USB Type-C ConnEx, you need:

-   **System under test (SUT)**

    Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones with at least one exposed Type-C USB port.

-   **Arduino Mega 2560 R3**

    [Arduino Mega 2560 R3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733526) is used as the microcontroller for the test setup. This board can be purchased from the [Arduino store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733526).

    ![arduino](images/arduino.png)

-   **Power adapter for the microcontroller**.

    For information about compatible adapters for the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 board, [see this site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=733660).

-   **USB Type-C ConnEx**

    The shield has one male USB Type-C port (labeled **J1**) to which the SUT is connected. The shield also has four other USB ports (labeled **J2**, **J3**, **J4**, **J6**) to which devices can be attached that act as peripherals to the SUT. The shield monitors amperage and voltage being drawn from the SUT. You can buy this board from [MCCI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733488) or [JJG Technologies]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618287).

    ![USB Type-C ConnEx](images/connexc-top.png)

-   **USB A-to-B cable**

    You will use this cable to connect a PC to the microcontroller in order to update the firmware on the microcontroller to run tests.

-   **Peripheral USB devices**

    Any USB device with a USB Type-C port that can be attached to the SUT. This category includes traditional USB devices and other devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

-   **USB charger**

    USB Type-C that supports USB Type-C current requirements and optionally [USB Power Delivery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=623310). You also need a USB Micro-B charger for **J6**.

-   **Proxy controller**

    The USB Type-C ConnEx can be controlled by using a proxy for running the tests. The proxy controller can be one of these entities:

    -   Secondary desktop PC or a laptop.

        The proxy controller communicates, with a mobile SUT; the microcontroller to load the firmware.

    -   SUT by using a secondary USB port.
    -   SUT by using a 3.5mm audio jack.

        In this set up, you need:

        -   DTMF shield to run tests on SUTs with a single USB Type-C port. DTMF provides the ability to control the shield from a single-port device with an audio jack after the initial flash of the firmware has been completed.

            ![dtmf shield](images/dtmf.png)

        -   4-pin male-to-male audio cable used to connect the DTMF shield to the SUT. This allows the SUT to control the USB Type-C shield during testing.

            ![3.5mm audio jack](images/audio-jack.png)

## Software requirements


Make sure you meet these requirements:

-   Your SUT must have the version of the Windows operating system with which you want to test interoperability.
-   The proxy controller must be running Windows 10.
-   [![download the mutt software package](images/download.png)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=786621) and install the latest MUTT software package on the proxy controller.
-   The package is a suite of tools used to run tests with USB Type-C ConnEx .

    It includes utilities to update the firmware, switch between the peripheral ports, and send requests to simulate test cases. It also contains test driver packages that test the functionality of the buses, its controller, and devices connected to the bus.

-   Installation of the test tools requires an elevated command window.

    To open an elevated command window, the user must be a member of the **Administrators** group on the proxy controller. To open an elevated Command Prompt window, create a desktop shortcut to Cmd.exe, right-click the Cmd.exe shortcut, and select **Run as administrator**.

Follow this procedure to set up your test environment.

![USB Type-C ConnEx configuration](images/connexc.png)

The configuration should be similar to this image. Note that the USB Type-C port on the microcontroller provides control over USB Type-C ConnEx when connected to a PC.

In these steps, you will connect the hardware pieces, update the firmware on the microcontroller, and validate the installation. The DTMF shield provides control over USB Type-C ConnEx when connected to the audio port of a phone or tablet.

1.  Connect the microcontroller to the USB Type-C shield.

    If the USB Type-C ConnEx did not come assembled, then continue with step 1. If your USB Type-C ConnEx has been assembled, then proceed to step 2.

    **Caution**  ![caution](images/caution.png) This step must be performed carefully because the pins bend easily.

     

    1.  Align the pins of the USB Type-C shield with the receptors on the microcontroller by making sure that the boards are level to each other.

        ![align pins of the USB Type-C ConnEx](images/connexc-align.png)

    2.  Gently press the two boards together. Be careful not to bend the pins on the shield.

        ![assembling the USB Type-C ConnEx](images/connexc-connect.png)

        Your assembled unit should be similar to this image:

        ![connected connex-c board](images/connexc-connect1.png)

2.  Power the USB Type-C ConnEx from the attached microcontroller by using either the USB Type-B (connected to the proxy controller) or from an external power adapter. The LCD display is similar to this image:

    After five seconds, the LCD display shows the current and voltage.

    ![USB Type-C ConnEx before firmware boot](images/connexc-connect2.png)![USB Type-C ConnEx before firmware boot](images/connexc-connect3.png)

    If you do not the see display as shown in the previous image, make sure your have assembled the unit correctly.

3.  Update the microcontroller with the USB Type-C ConnEx firmware.
    -   Open an elevated Command Prompt window.
    -   Navigate to the location of the MUTT software package, such as C:\\Program Files (x86)\\USBTest\\*&lt;arch&gt;*.
    -   Run the following command:

        **MuttUtil.exe –UpdateTabFirmware**

4.  Plug in the SUT to the male USB Type-C port (labeled **J1**) on the shield.

    **Caution**  The **J1** connector requires additional support when connecting the SUT. The connector is not sturdy enough to sustain the weight of a device or by itself.

     

    ![attaching system under test (sut)](images/connexc-connect4.png)

5.  Attach the peripherals to the USB ports labeled **J2**, **J3**, **J4**, **J6**.

    ![attach peripherals to the USB Type-C ConnEx](images/connexc-connect7.png)

6.  Attach the proxy controller to the microcontroller.
    -   If the proxy controller is a desktop PC or laptop, establish connection over USB. Connect the USB Type-B port on the microcontroller to a USB port on the proxy controller, as shown in the preceding image.
    -   If the proxy controller is a mobile SUT, establish connection by using the audio port. For this connection, you need the DTMF shield.
        1.  Connect the DTMF shield to the assembled unit as shown in this image:

            ![dtmf attachment](images/connexc-connect6.png)

        2.  Connect the audio port of the shield to the audio port on the SUT by using a 4-pin male-to-male audio cable.

            Your setup should be similar to this image:

            ![attaching system under test (sut) with dtmf](images/connexc-connect5.png)

7.  Make sure USB Type-C ConnEx is recognized by Device Manager on the proxy controller.
    1.  Right-click the Start button in the task bar and select **Device Manager**.
    2.  Expand the **Ports (COM & LPT)** node and note the COM port that is used by the microcontroller. In this example, it is connected to COM 4.

    connexutil.exe /setport %p
    echo Confirm device on port %p
    pause
)
```

## <a href="" id="scripts"></a>Scripts for controlling the USB Type-C ConnEx board


These scripts exercise the control interface supported by ConnExUtil.exe to run sequential and stress type tests with the USB Type-C ConnEx through the command line. All of these scripts support the optional command line parameter **audio** to indicate that the USB Type-C ConnEx board is connected over the 3.5 mm audio interface. By default they will only attempt to use USB connected boards.

### <a href="" id="cxloop"></a>Simple connect / disconnect sequence: CXLOOP.CMD

Connects and disconnects the SUT to and from each port (1-4) and pauses on each port prompting the tester to validate the connection on that port.

### <a href="" id="cxstress"></a>Random connect / disconnect loop: CXSTRESS.CMD

Connects and disconnects the SUT to and from each port at random for a random interval of 0.0-5.0 seconds in an infinite loop. When connecting to the USB Type-C ports it will randomly enable or disable SuperSpeed connection on that port, and will randomly instruct the board to disconnect quickly on that port at some random interval 0 – 999 ms.

The command line parameter **C** causes the script to only switch between the USB Type-C ports and the disconnected state. A numeric command line parameter resets the maximum random interval between switches from the default of 5.0 seconds to the input value in seconds. Parameters may be passed in any order.

### <a href="" id="cxpower"></a>Long running power measurement: CXPOWER.CMD

Saves the amperage and voltage reported by the USB Type-C ConnEx to output file power.csv at 2 second intervals. The data is formatted as comma-separated variables as follows:

*index***,***time***,***volts***,***amps*

*index* is the device index given by the **ConnExUtil.exe /list** command so multiple devices may be monitored simultaneously.

*time* is the raw timestamp in seconds.

*volts* and *amps* are recorded to 2 decimal places.

After capture is complete, this data may be post processed into charts showing power consumption over time, for example the power consumption for the duration of a battery charge cycle. A numeric command line parameter resets the default measurement interval of 2 seconds to the input value in seconds.

##  About test cases


The USB Type-C interoperability test procedures are divided into two sections: functional testing (FT) and stress testing (ST). Each test section describes the test case and identifies the category that applies to the test. The product must be tested against the entire applicable category. Certain test cases contain links to relevant hints and tips for additional information. This section is focused on USB Type-C functionality and experience. A USB Type-C solution may contains other USB components such as a USB hub or USB controller. Detailed testing of USB hubs and controllers is covered in both the USB-IF's [xHCI interoperability test procedures](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623257) and the Windows Hardware Certification Kit.

These test cases are based on the ConnExUtil commands and example scripts [Scripts for controlling the USB Type-C ConnEx board](#scripts). The test cases refer to the scripts. Customize the scripts as required for your test scenario.

<a href="" id="device-enumeration"></a>[Device Enumeration](#ft1)  
Confirms that core aspects of device enumeration are functional.

<a href="" id="alternate-mode-negotiation"></a>[Alternate Mode Negotiation](#ft2)  
Confirms supported alternate modes.

<a href="" id="charging-and-power-delivery--pd-"></a>[Charging and power delivery (PD)](#ft3)

The stress testing section describes procedures for stress and edge case scenarios, which test device stability over a period of time. Stress testing does require a custom device (the SuperMUTT) for legacy USB validation (non USB Type-C). Additional testing and automation can be achieved with the upcoming USB Type-C test device.

## Validating success or failure of the tests


### Confirming charging and power

The onboard LCD on the USB Type-C ConnEx displays power (volts, amps, and direction). Confirm that it matches expectations from power sources plugged in and actively enabled with the USB Type-C ConnEx .

![confirming charging and power](images/connexc-connect9.png)

### Confirming device addition on desktops

1.  Identify the USB host controller to which your device is connected.
2.  Make sure that the new device appears under the correct node in Device Manager.
3.  For USB 3.0 hubs connected to a USB 3.0 port, expect to see two hub devices: one enumerated at SuperSpeed and another at high speed.

### Confirm device removal on desktops

1.  Identify your device in Device Manager.
2.  Perform the test step to remove the device from the system.
3.  Confirm that the device is no longer present in Device Manager.
4.  For a USB 3.0 hub, check that both devices (SuperSpeed and companion hubs) are removed. Failure to remove a device in this case may be a device failure and should be investigated by all components involved to triage the appropriate root cause.

### Confirm device functionality

-   If the device is a USB hub, make sure that the devices that are downstream of the hub are functional. Verify that other devices can be connected to available ports on the hub.
-   If the device is an HID device, test its functionality. Make sure that a USB keyboard types, a USB mouse moves the cursor, and a gaming device is functional in the game controller's control panel.
-   A USB audio device must play and/or record sound.
-   A storage device must be accessible and should be able to copy a file 200MB or more in size.
-   If the device has multiple functions, such as scan & print, make sure to test both the scan and print functionality.
-   If the device is a USB Type-C device, confirm that the applicable USB and alternate modes are functional.

## Using ETW to log issues


To enable ETW for USB 2.0 ports, see [ETW in the Windows 7 USB core stack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623316).

To enable USB 3.0 logging, perform the following commands instead (or see [How to capture a USB event trace with Logman](how-to-capture-a-usb-event-trace.md)):

``` syntax
logman start usbtrace -ets -o usbtrace.etl -nb 128 640 -bs 128
logman update usbtrace -ets -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-UCX Default
logman update usbtrace -ets -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-USBHUB3 Default
```

After these are logs are captured, perform the test scenario.

Stop the trace by using this command:

``` syntax
logman stop usbtrace -ets
```

## Reporting test results


Provide these details:

-   The list of tests (in order) that were performed before the failed test.
-   The list must specify the tests that have failed or passed.
-   Systems, devices, docks, or hubs that were used for the tests. Include make, model, and Web site so that we can get additional information, if needed.

# USB hardware verifier (USB3HWVerifierAnalyzer.exe)


This topic describes the USB hardware verifier tool (USB3HWVerifierAnalyzer.exe) that is used for testing and debugging specific hardware events.

Most hardware issues manifest in ways that lead to poor end-user experience and it's often difficult to determine the exact failure. The USB hardware verifier aims at capturing hardware failures that occur in a device, port, hub, controller, or a combination of them.

The USB hardware verifier can perform these tasks:

-   Capture hardware events and display information in real time.
-   Generate a trace file with information about all events.
-   Parse an existing trace file for event information.

This topic contains the following sections:

-   [Getting the USB hardware verifier analyzer tool](#getting-the-usb-hardware-verifier-analyzer-tool)
-   [How to capture events by using a USB hardware verifier](#how-to-capture-events-by-using-a-usb-hardware-verifier)
-   [USB hardware verifier flags](#usb-hardware-verifier-flags)

## Getting the USB hardware verifier analyzer tool


The USB hardware verifier tool is included with the MUTT software package that is available for download at [Tools in the MUTT software package](mutt-software-package.md).

The tools package contains several tools that perform stress and transfer tests (including power transitions) and SuperSpeed tests. The package also has a Readme document (available as a separate download). The document gives you a brief overview of the types of MUTT hardware. It provides step-by-step guidance about various tests you should run, and suggests topologies for controller, hub, device, and BIOS/UEFI testing.

## How to capture events by using a USB hardware verifier


To capture events by using the hardware verifier, perform these steps:

1.  Start a session by running this command at an elevated command prompt.

    ``` syntax
    USB3HWVerifierAnalyzer.exe
    ```

    The tool supports these options:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><a href="" id="---v--vendorid-"></a> -v &lt;VendorID&gt;</p></td>
    <td><p>Logs all hardware verifier events for the specified VendorID.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><a href="" id="----p--productid-"></a> -p &lt;ProductID&gt;</p></td>
    <td><p>Logs all hardware verifier events for the specified ProductID.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><a href="" id="-f--etl-file-"></a>-f &lt;ETL file&gt;</p></td>
    <td><p>Parses the specified ETL file. Real-time parsing is not supported. With this option, the tool parses the file offline.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>/v output</p></td>
    <td><p>Displays all events to the console.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Â 

2.  Run the test scenario for which you want to capture hardware events.

    During a session, USB hardware verifier captures information about hardware events as they occur. If you want to filter events for a particular hardware, specify the VendorId and ProductId of the hardware. The tool might not capture some information (such as VID/PID) about events that occur before the device gets fully enumerated. The missing information is available in the detailed report that is generated at the end of the session (discussed next).

    Here is an example output from the hardware verifier tool:

    ``` syntax

3.  Stop the session by pressing CTRL+C.

    At the end of the session, a file named AllEvents.etl is added in the current directory. This file contains trace information about all events that were captured during the session.

    In addition to AllEvents.etl, the command window shows a report. The report includes certain information that was missed in the real-time output. The following output shows an example test report for the preceding session. The report shows all events that the USB hardware verifier encountered.

    ```

    In the preceding example report, note the **Key** field value for each record. The report categorizes the information by those **Key** values, making it easier to read. The same **Key** values are used in events captured in AllEvents.etl.

4.  Convert AllEvents.etl to text format by running the following command:

    ``` syntax
    USB3HWVerifierAnalyzer.exe -f AllEvents.etl /v > Output.txt 
    ```

    In the output file, search for the previously noted **Key** values. The values are associated with one of these fields: **fid\_UcxController**, **fid\_HubDevice**, and **fid\_UsbDevice**.

5.  Open AllEvents.etl in Netmon and select **Add &lt;field\_name&gt; to display filter** to filter events by controller, hub, and device.

| DeviceHwVerifierInterfaceWakeCapabilityMismatch     | The RemoteWake bit is incorrectly set in the device. USB 3.0 devices that support remote wake must also support function wake. There are two ways in which the device indicates its support for function wake. The first way is through the **bmAttributes** field of the configuration descriptor and the second way is in its response to the GET\_STATUS request targeted to the interface. For a non-composite device, the RemoteWake bit value must match the value returned by the GET\_STATUS request that is targeted to interface 0. For composite devices, the RemoteWake bit must be 1 for at least one of the functions. Otherwise, this flag indicates that the device reported contradictory values in here. |

| HubHwVerifierPortDeviceDisconnected                 | The downstream device on the target port is no longer connected to the bus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| HubHwVerifierPortOverCurrent                        | The downstream port reported overcurrent state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| HubHwVerifierControllerOperationFailure             | A controller operation (such as enabling device, configuring endpoints) failed for the device that is attached to the target port. Failures from SET\_ADDRESS and Reset endpoint requests are not captured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

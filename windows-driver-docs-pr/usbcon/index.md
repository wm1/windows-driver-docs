# Universal Serial Bus (USB)


Universal Serial Bus (USB) provides an expandable, hot-pluggable Plug and Play serial interface that ensures a standard, low-cost connection for peripheral devices such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, printers, scanners, storage devices, modems, and video conferencing cameras. Migration to USB is recommended for all peripheral devices that use legacy ports such as PS/2, serial, and parallel ports.

The USB-IF is a Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that maintains the [Official USB Specification](http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/), test specifications and tools.

Windows operating systems include native support for USB host controllers, hubs, and devices and systems that comply with the official USB specification. Windows also provides programming interfaces that you can use to develop [device drivers](usb-driver-development-guide.md) and [applications](developing-windows-applications-that-communicate-with-a-usb-device.md) that communicate with a USB device.

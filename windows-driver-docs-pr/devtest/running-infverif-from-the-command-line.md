# Running InfVerif from the command line


This topic lists the options that are available when you run InfVerif.exe from the command line.
> [!NOTE]
> InfVerif requires that each combined path and file name must be less than 260 characters.

```
USAGE: InfVerif.exe [/v] [/u | /universal] [/info] [/stampinf] [/l <path>] [/osver TargetOSVersion>] [/product <ias file>] <files>

/v
        Display verbose file logging details.

/u
        Reports errors if INF is not Universal.

/info
        Displays INF summary information.

/stampinf
        Treat $ARCH$ as a valid architecture, to validate pre-stampinf files.

/l <path>
        An inline-annotated HTML version of each INF
        file will be placed in the <path>.

/osver <TargetOsVersion>
        Process the INF for a specific target OS.
        Formatting is the same as a Models section, i.e. NTAMD64.6.0

/product <ias file>
        Validates all include/needs directives against
        the product definition in the ias file.

<files>
        A space-separated list of INF files to analyze.
        Wildcards (*) may be used.
```

The verbose option adds a line to the output that specifies if the INF is valid or not.

*New for Windows 10, version 1703:*  The info option is especially useful to verify INF applicability.  It reports each supported hardware ID along with valid architecture and minimum OS version.  You can use /info and /osver together to validate an INF's applicability across OS versions and architectures.

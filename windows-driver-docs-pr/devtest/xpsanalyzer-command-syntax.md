### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

When XpsAnalyzer analyzes an XML file, it creates the following two files that contain the analysis report.

<span id="xpsanalyzer_result.htm_______"></span><span id="XPSANALYZER_RESULT.HTM_______"></span>**XpsAnalyzer\_Result.htm**   
The XPS analysis report in HyperText Markup (HTM) format.

<span id="xpsanalyzer_result.xml_______"></span><span id="XPSANALYZER_RESULT.XML_______"></span>**XpsAnalyzer\_Result.xml**   
The XPS analysis report in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format.

Within these files, the name of the XPS file that has been analyzed is followed by the analysis report.

If the **/Directory:** argument is specified, the file contains the analysis of every XPS file that resides in the specified directory. The name of each file is followed by the XPS analysis for that file.

If the **/FlushSql:** argument is specified, XpsAnalyzer creates two SQL files along with the XpsAnalyzer\_Result.htm and XpsAnalyzer\_Result.xml files. The details of the SQL files are as folllows:

<span id="setup_sqlserver.sql_______"></span><span id="SETUP_SQLSERVER.SQL_______"></span>**Setup\_SqlServer.sql**   
This file contains a script to prepare an SQL database that can be used to search on the XPS analysis.

<span id="update_sqlserver.sql_______"></span><span id="UPDATE_SQLSERVER.SQL_______"></span>**Update\_SqlServer.sql**   
This file contains a script to insert the XPS analysis results into the SQL database created through the Setup\_SqlServer.sql script.

For an example of an XPS analysis report, see [XpsAnalyzer Output](xpsanalyzer-output.md).

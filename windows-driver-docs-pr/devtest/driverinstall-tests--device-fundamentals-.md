# Driver Install Tests (Device Fundamentals)


The Driver Install test category includes tests that uninstall and reinstall a driver several times to test install functionality. The tests initiate I/O testing against the driver and device after each reinstall. The tests are designed to improve the overall experience for end users who need to install and reinstall a device driver or a device.

This test does the following:

1.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
2.  Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
3.  Reinstalls the original driver on the test device using [**IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UpdateDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450945) method.
4.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
5.  Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
6.  Reboots the system if step \#3 requires a reboot.
7.  Installs NULL driver on the test device using [**IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UnInstallDriverPermanently**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450941) method Reboots the system if a reboot is required.
8.  Reinstalls the original driver on device under test using [**IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UpdateDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450945) method.
9.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
10. Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
11. Repeats step 1 - 10 several times.

The Setup API logs (setupapi.app.log and setupapi.dev.log) contain useful information to debug driver installation failures logged by this test. The Setup API logs can be found under %windir%\\inf\\ directory on the test system.

To increase the verbosity and potential usefulness of these logs, set the following registry key to 0x2000FFFF before running the Reinstall test:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\LogLevel
```

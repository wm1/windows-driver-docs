# Debugging NDIS/WiFi time-out errors - DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION (C4)


When you have the [NDIS/WIFI verification](ndis-wifi-verification.md) option selected, and Driver Verifier detects that the driver violates one of the NDIS/WiFi time-out rules, [Driver Verifier](driver-verifier.md) generates [**Bug Check 0xC4: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560187) (with Parameter 1 equal to the identifier of the specific NDIS/WiFi time-out rule).

When Driver Verifier is testing a NDIS/WIFI time-out rule, such as [**NdisTimedOidComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn305120), Driver Verifier’s polling mechanism expects a response from the miniport driver within a number of cycles. Each timed rule has defined its own maximum cycle allowed. When the maximum is exceeded, Driver Verifier generates a bug check. This section describes some example strategies for debugging these violations.

## Debugging NDIS/WIFI timeout errors


-   [Use !analyze to display information about the bug check](#use-analyze-to-display-information-about-the-bug-check)
-   [Use the !ruleinfo extension command](#use-the-ruleinfo-extension-command)
-   [Click the LAST\_CALL\_STACK link to identify the location of the violation](#identify-the-location-of-the-violation)
-   [Fixing the cause of the NDIS/WIFI timeout violation](#fixing-the-cause-of-the-ndis-wifi-timeout-violation)

### Use !analyze to display information about the bug check

As with any bug check that occurs, once you have control of the debugger, the best first step is to run the [**!analyze -v**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562112) command.

```
DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)
A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught.  This is
because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the
administrator) and the kernel has enabled substantial checking of this driver.
If the driver attempts to corrupt the system, bugchecks 0xC4, 0xC1 and 0xA will
be among the most commonly seen crashes.
Arguments:
Arg1: 00092003, ID of the 'NdisTimedOidComplete' rule that was violated.
Arg2: 8521dd34, A pointer to the string describing the violated rule condition.
Arg3: 9c17b860, Address of internal rule state (second argument to !ruleinfo).
Arg4: 9c1f3480, Address of supplemental states (third argument to !ruleinfo).
```

In the following section of the **!analyze -v** output, the reason why the rule was violated under is shown under the DV\_VIOLATED\_CONDITION field. The DV\_MSDN\_LINK section is also useful to pull up a link to documentation on this rule.

```
## Debugging Details:

Further down this analysis output, you can click on the link under the DV\_RULE\_INFO section for additional rule descriptions. For time-out type of rules, the current stack might not contain relevant information.

### Use the !ruleinfo extension command

The **DV\_RULE\_INFO:** field of the **!analyze** output shows a link to the command you can use to find more information about this rule violation. For this example, if you click the link, it runs the [**!ruleinfo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265374) command with the RULE\_ID (0x92003) the Arg3 and Arg 4 bug check values.

```
kd> !ruleinfo 0x92003 0xffffffff9c17b860 0xffffffff9c1f3480

RULE_ID: 0x92003

RULE_NAME: NdisTimedOidComplete

RULE_DESCRIPTION:
This rule verifies if an NDIS miniport driver completes an OID in time.
The OID is tracked (a.k.a., TRACKED_OBJECT). Use !ndiskd.oid .

MSDN_LINK: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=278804

CONTEXT: Miniport 0x86BD10E8

CURRENT_TIME (Timed Rules): 168 seconds

TRACKED_OBJECT: 0x86633804

LAST_CALL_STACK: 0x9C1F3480 + 0x10

RULE_STATE: 0x9C1F3480
```

### Identify the location of the violation

In the example we are using here, the miniport driver, NdisTimedOidComplete.sys, has a sleep cycle injected into its *MPOidRequest* function. We can check by clicking on the LAST\_CALL\_STACK link in the [**!ruleinfo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265374) output. This is the last call stack seen by Driver Verifier, where we see that NDIS called *ndisMInvokeOidRequest* before the time out occurred.

```
kd> dps 0x9C1F3480 + 0x10
9c1f3490  850e1e37 ndis!ndisMInvokeOidRequest+0x16641

9c1f34ac  85104005 ndis!ndisMInitializeAdapter+0xad7
```

### Fixing the cause of the NDIS WIFI timeout violation

When the crash dump has been generated for a timed rule, there is a possibility that the root cause can be found at the time of the crash dump. To debug further, consider starting with the NdisKd debugger extension commands, see [NDIS Extensions (Ndiskd.dll)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552270) and [Getting started with NDISKD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=327569). You may also need to look at [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](event-tracing-for-windows--etw-.md) logs, if your driver has implemented ETW. If this rule were not enabled, this error will manifest itself as user application hang at best, or a [**Bug Check 0x9F: DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559329) at the worst.

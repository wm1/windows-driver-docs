# PnPUtil Examples


This topic provides the following examples on how to use the PnPUtil tool:

-   [Adding a driver package to the driver store](#adding-a-driver-package-to-the-driver-store)

-   [Installing a driver package](#installing-a-driver-package)

-   [Listing the driver packages within the driver store](#listing-the-driver-packages-within-the-driver-store)

-   [Deleting a driver package from the driver store](#deleting-a-driver-package-from-the-driver-store)

## Adding a driver package to the driver store


The following example adds a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840), which contains the [INF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402) file that is named MyDriver.inf, to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868):

```
C:\>pnputil /a m:\MyDriver.inf
Microsoft PnP Utility

Processing inf : MyDriver.inf
Driver package added successfully.
Published name : oem22.inf
```

As soon as it is added to the driver store, the INF file for the driver package is referenced within the store through its published named (oem22.inf).

## Installing a driver package

The following example adds the driver package to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868) and then installs the driver package on the computer:

```
C:\>pnputil /a m:\MyDriver.inf /i
Microsoft PnP Utility
```

## Listing the driver packages within the driver store

The following example lists the [driver packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) that are currently in the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). Only driver packages that are not in-box packages are listed. An *in-box* driver package is one which is included in the default installation of Windows or its service packs:

```
C:\>pnputil /e
Microsoft PnP Utility

Published name : oem0.inf
Driver package provider : Microsoft
Class : Printers
Driver version and date : Unknown driver version and date
Signer name : microsoft windows

Published name : oem22.inf
Driver package provider : Fabrikam, Inc.
Class : Network adapters
Driver version and date : 10/07/2009 1.0.200.0
Signer name : microsoft windows hardware compatibility publisher
```

In this example, information is displayed about the [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) that is referenced by the published INF file (oem22.inf). This information includes the publisher (Fabrikam, Inc.), setup class (Network adapter) and version (1.0.200.0) of the driver package.

**Note**   In this example, the data for the "Signer Name" field indicates that the sample driver package was digitally signed by a [Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) release signature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553976). If the driver package was not digitally signed, there would be no data displayed in the "Signer Name" field.

 

## Deleting a driver package from the driver store


The following example removes the [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) from the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). The driver package is referenced by its published INF file (oem22.inf):

```
C:\>pnputil /d oem22.inf
Microsoft PnP Utility

Driver package deleted successfully.
```

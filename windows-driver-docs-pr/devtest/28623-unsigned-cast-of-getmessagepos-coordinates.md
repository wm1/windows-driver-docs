# C28623


warning C28623: Unsigned cast of GetMessagePos() coordinates. Use GET\_X\_LPARAM/GET\_Y\_LPARAM instead of LOWORD/HIWORD

Systems with multiple monitors can have negative x-coordinates and y-coordinates. On such systems, **GetMessagePos** may therefore return negative values. However, because **LOWORD** and **HIWORD** treat the coordinates as unsigned quantities, they should not be used.

### <span id="example"></span><span id="EXAMPLE"></span>Example

PREfast reports the warning for the following example.

```
DWORD dw = GetMessagePos();
POINT ppt;

ppt.x = LOWORD(dw);
ppt.y = HIWORD(dw);
```

The following example avoids the error.

```
DWORD dw = GetMessagePos();
POINT ppt;

ppt.x = GET_X_LPARAM(dw);
ppt.y = GET_Y_LPARAM(dw);
```

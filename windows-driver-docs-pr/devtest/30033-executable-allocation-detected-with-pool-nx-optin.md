# C30033


warning C30033: Executable allocation was detected in a driver compiled with [POOL\_NX\_OPTIN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh920402). This driver has been determined to be loaded at run time by another driver. Please verify that the loading driver calls **ExInitializeDriverRuntime(*DrvRtPoolNxOptIn*)** in its DriverEntry.

BANNED\_MEM\_ALLOCATION\_MAYBE\_UNSAFE\_DRIVER\_LOADED

It has been determined that this is a DLL that is loaded by another driver, and as such does not have a complete initialization function. Verify the loading driver is:

-   Compiled using [POOL\_NX\_OPTIN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh920402)=1
-   Calls **ExInitializeDriverRuntime(*DrvRtPoolNxOptIn*)** in its initialization function

If the loading driver specifies these correctly, then the warning can be ignored.

The following code in every loader of the DLL means that you should make the change (as per the safe example below)

In the sources file

```
C_DEFINES=$(C_DEFINES)
```

In **DriverEntry**, before any memory allocation takes place:

```
NTSTATUS
DriverEntry (
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,
    _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
    )
{
    NTSTATUS status;
…
    // No call to ExInitializeDriverRuntime
    return(status)
}
```

The following code in every loader of the DLL means that you can ignore the warning.

In the sources file, add

```
C_DEFINES=$(C_DEFINES) -DPOOL_NX_OPTIN=1
```

In **DriverEntry**, before any memory allocation takes place:

```
NTSTATUS
DriverEntry (
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,
    _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
    )
{
    NTSTATUS status;

    ExInitializeDriverRuntime( DrvRtPoolNxOptIn );
…
```

A second way to fix this is to make every call explicitly reference non-executable memory.

The following code generates this warning.

```
ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonPagedPool, numberOfBytes, &#39;xppn&#39;);
```

The following code avoids this warning:

```
ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonPagedPoolNx, numberOfBytes, &#39;xppn&#39;);
```

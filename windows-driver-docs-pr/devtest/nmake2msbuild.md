# Nmake2MsBuild


**Note**  The Nmake2MsBuild tool was removed from the WDK starting in Windows 10, version 1511.

 

The Nmake2MsBuild utility generates a Visual Studio project for a driver that was built using a previous version of the WDK from your driver's source code files, and from the *sources*, *dirs*, and *makefile.inc* files. The utility creates the Visual Studio project file in the same directory as your existing *sources* files. The utility does not alter your source code or your earlier build files.

For information about using the utility, see [Converting a WDK sources file to a Visual Studio project](converting-a-wdk-sources-file-to-a-visual-studio-project.md).

The Nmake2MsBuild.exe utility has the following syntax:

```
NMake2MSBuild.exe  < sources [<sources>...] | dirs >
                          [-Name:<Name of output project>]
                          [-Package:<Path to package project file to generate>]
                          [-Solution:<Path to Solution file to generate>]
                          [-Log:[<LogFile>]:[<Verbosity>]]
                          [-ConsoleLog:<Verbosity>]
                          [-NoPackageProject]
                          [-NoSolution]
                          [-SafeMode]
             
```

The conversion tool is located in the %PROGRAMFILES%\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\tools\\x86\\ directory.

The conversion tool is located in the %PROGRAMFILES%\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\tools\\x86\\ directory.

Response (.Rsp) files are supported for specifying command line parameters. Each parameters should be specified on a separate line.

## <span id="Example"></span><span id="example"></span><span id="EXAMPLE"></span>Example


To build a driver project that was built with a previous version of the WDK (using Build.exe and a sources and dirs file), you must first convert it to a .VcxProj project using Nmake2MsBuild.exe conversion utility.

For example, to convert a driver that was previously built with the Windows 7 WDK, called MyDriver, you first open a **Visual Studio Command Prompt** window. Browse to the directory or supply the path to the directory that contains the *sources* or *dirs* build configuration file. For example, the following command generates the MyDriver.Vcxproj file in the same folder as the *sources* file.

```
nmake2msbuild.exe  .\myDriver\sources
```

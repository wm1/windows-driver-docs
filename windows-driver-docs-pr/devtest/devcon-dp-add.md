# DevCon Dp\_add


Adds a third-party (OEM) driver package to the driver store on the local computer.

```
    devcon dp_add inf

   
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______inf______"></span><span id="_______INF______"></span> *inf*   
The fully qualified path and name of the INF file for the driver package.

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

A DevCon dp\_add command copies the specified INF file to the %windir%/Inf directory and renames it OEM\*.inf. This file name is unique on the computer and you cannot specify it.

If this INF file already exists in %windir%/Inf (as determined by comparing the binary files, not by matching the file names) and the catalog (.cat) file for the INF is identical to a catalog file in the directory, the INF file is not recopied to the %windir%/Inf directory.

This command calls the **SetupCopyOEMInf** function with no *CopyStyle* flags. **SetupCopyOEMInf** is described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

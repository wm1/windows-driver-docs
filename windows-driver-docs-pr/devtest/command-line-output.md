# Command-Line Output


When you submit a command to SDV, it displays a header with version information, status messages that indicate the success or failure of the command, and any error messages or warnings that might have been generated. A summary of the results of the verification appears at the bottom of the output.

For example, the following illustration shows the command-line output from a command to verify the Fail\_Driver1 sample driver with the rules in the Config.sdv[rule list file](static-driver-verifier-rule-list-file.md). The Fail\_Driver1 sample driver, a driver with intentional coding errors, and the Config.sdv file are installed in the \\tools\\sdv\\sample\\fail\_drivers\\wdm\\fail\_driver1 subdirectory of the WDK.

In this verification, SDV found four defects, one for each rule that it verified.

After viewing the results summary to see which rules were violated, you can specify the **/view** option in an MSBuild command to see the Static Driver Verifier Report. For information about the command options, see [Static Driver Verifier commands (MSBuild)](-static-driver-verifier-commands--msbuild-.md). For information about the **Build** and **Check** steps in the output, see [Verification Process](verification-process.md).

The following table describes the results that can appear in the results summary.

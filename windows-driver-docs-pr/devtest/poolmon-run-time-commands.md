Toggles the display through nonpaged allocations, paged allocations, and both.

<span id="_________or__"></span><span id="_________OR__"></span> **(** or **)**  
Toggles the display between sorting by value (allocations, free operations, and bytes) and sorting by change in value. You can use either parenthesis character. They have the same effect.

Toggles the display between the system pools and the Terminal Services session pools.

<span id="_______TSSessionID______"></span><span id="_______tssessionid______"></span><span id="_______TSSESSIONID______"></span> *TSSessionID*   
Displays allocations from the specified Terminal Services session pool. *TSSessionID* represents the session ID of a Terminal Services session. It must be an integer from 0 through 9. To display all session pools or to enter session IDs greater than 9, use the **i** command.

<span id="_______i______"></span><span id="_______I______"></span> **i**   
Prompts you for the session ID of a Terminal Server session. You can respond in the following two ways:

-   To display allocations from all Terminal Services session pools, press ENTER.

Sorts by tag name.

<span id="_______a______"></span><span id="_______A______"></span> **a**   
Sorts by number of allocations. When used with a parenthesis character, the **a** key sorts by the change in allocations.

<span id="_______f______"></span><span id="_______F______"></span> **f**   
Sorts by number of free operations. When used with a parenthesis character, the **f** key sorts by the change in free operations.

Sorts by the difference between bytes allocated and bytes freed.

<span id="_______b______"></span><span id="_______B______"></span> **b**   
Sorts by bytes used. When used with a parenthesis character, the **b** key sorts by the change in bytes used.

<span id="_______m______"></span><span id="_______M______"></span> **m**   
Sorts by bytes-per-allocation. When used with a parenthesis character, the **m** key sorts by the change in bytes-per-allocations.

<span id="_________or_h"></span><span id="_________OR_H"></span> **?** or **h**

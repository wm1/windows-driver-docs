Unlike the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system only if required to make a change effective, the **DevCon Reboot** operation reboots the system without determining whether a reboot is required.

DevCon uses the standard **ExitWindowsEx** function to reboot. If the user has open files on the computer or a program will not close, the system does not reboot until the user has responded to system prompts to close the files or end the process. For more information about **ExitWindowsEx**, see the Microsoft Windows SDK.

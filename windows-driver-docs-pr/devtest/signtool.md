### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

SignTool supports a large number of options. The options described in this topic are limited to the ones that you can use to sign or verify a driver package or driver file.

For a complete list of SignTool parameters, see the Microsoft [SignTool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=62661) website.

For more information about signing files, see the Microsoft [Cryptography Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=10637) website.

A 32-bit version of SignTool is located in the bin\\i386 folder of the WDK. A 64-bit version of the tool is located in the bin\\amd64 and bin\\ia64 folders of the WDK.

### <span id="signing_examples"></span><span id="SIGNING_EXAMPLES"></span>Signing Examples

The following is an example of how to sign a [driver package's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) catalog file using a Software Publisher Certificate (SPC) and a corresponding cross-certificate. This example is valid for signing a driver package for 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, which enforce the kernel-mode code signing policy. The example signs the driver package's catalog file AbcCatFileName.cat. To sign the catalog file, the example uses the cross-certificate AbcCrossCertificate and the AbcSPCCertificate certificate. The AbcSPCCertificate certificate is located in the AbcCertificateStore certificate store.

The example also uses a publicly-available timestamp server to sign the catalog file. The timestamp server is provided by VeriSign and its URL is http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll.

```
SignTool sign /ac AbcCrossCertificate.cer /s AbcCertificateStore /n AbcSPCCertificate /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll AbcCatFileName.cat
```

The following is an example of how to embed a signature in a driver file using an SPC and cross-certificate. All the parameters are the same as in the example that signs a catalog file, except that the file that is signed is AbcDriverFile.sys instead of the catalog file AbcCatFileName.cat.

```
SignTool sign /ac AbcCrossCertificate.cer /s AbcCertificateStore /n AbcSPCCertificate /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll AbcDriverFile.sys
```

The following is an example of how to sign a [driver package's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) catalog file using a [commercial release certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539935) or a [commercial test certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539940). This example is valid for signing a driver package for 32-bit versions of Windows Vistaand later versions of Windows, which do not enforce the kernel-mode code signing policy. The example signs the driver package's catalog file CatalogFileName.cat. The example uses the AbcTestCertificate test certificate, located in the TestCertificateStore certificate store, to sign the catalog file.

The example also uses a publicly-available timestamp server to sign the catalog file. The timestamp server is provided by VeriSign and its URL is http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll.

```
SignTool sign /s TestCertificateStore /n AbcTestCertificate /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll CatalogFileName.cat
```

### <span id="verifying_examples"></span><span id="VERIFYING_EXAMPLES"></span>Verifying Examples

The following is an example of how to verify that the signature of a [driver package's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) catalog file complies with the kernel-mode code signing policy and the PnP device installation signing requirements. The example verifies the signature of the catalog file AbcCatalogFile.cat.

```
SignTool verify /kp CatalogFileName.cat
```

The following is an example of how to verify that the signature of a file listed in a driver package's catalog file complies with the kernel-mode code signing policy and the PnP device installation signing requirements. The example verifies the signature of the file AbcDriverPackage.inf, which must have a thumbprint entry in the catalog file CatalogFileName.cat.

```
SignTool verify /kp /c CatalogFileName.cat AbcDriverPackage.inf
```

The following is an example of how to verify that an embedded signature complies with the kernel-mode code signing policy on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows. The example verifies the signature that is embedded in the driver file AbcDriverFile.sys.

```
SignTool verify /kp AbcDriverFile.sys
```

The following is an example of how to verify that the signature of a [driver package's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) catalog file complies with the PnP device installation signing requirements. The example verifies the signature of the catalog file CatalogFileName.cat.

```
SignTool verify /pa CatalogFileName.cat
```

### <span id="example_of_adding_a_catalog_file_to_the_system_component__driver__data"></span><span id="EXAMPLE_OF_ADDING_A_CATALOG_FILE_TO_THE_SYSTEM_COMPONENT__DRIVER__DATA"></span>Example of Adding a Catalog File to the System Component (Driver) Database

The following is an example of how to use SignTool to add the catalog file CatalogFileName.cat to the system component (driver) database. The **/v** option configures SignTool to operate in verbose mode and the **/u** option configures SignTool to generate a unique name for the catalog file being added, if necessary, to prevent replacing an already existing catalog file that has the same name as CatalogFileName.cat.

```
SignTool catdb /v /u CatalogFileName.cat
```

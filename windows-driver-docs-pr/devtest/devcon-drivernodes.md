# DevCon DriverNodes


Lists all [driver packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539954) that are compatible with the device, along with their version and ranking. Valid only on the local computer.

```
    devcon drivernodes {* | ID [ID ...] | =class [ID [ID ...]]} 

   
```

## <span id="ddk_devcon_drivernodes_tools"></span><span id="DDK_DEVCON_DRIVERNODES_TOOLS"></span>Parameters


<span id="______________"></span> **\***   
Represents all devices on the computer.

<span id="_______ID______"></span><span id="_______id______"></span> *ID*   
Specifies all or part of a hardware ID, compatible ID, or device instance ID of a device. When specifying multiple IDs, type a space between each ID. IDs that include an ampersand character (**&**) must be enclosed in quotation marks.

The following special characters modify the ID parameter.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Character</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>*</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Matches any character or no character. Use the wildcard character (<strong>*</strong>) to create an ID pattern, for example, <strong>*disk*</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>@</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Indicates a device instance ID, for example, <strong>@ROOT\FTDISK\0000</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>'</strong></p>
<p>(single quote)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Matches the string literally (exactly as it appears). Precede a string with a single quote to indicate that an asterisk is part of the ID name and is not a wildcard character, for example, <strong>'*PNP0600</strong>, where *PNP0600 (including the asterisk) is the hardware ID.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

<span id="________class______"></span><span id="________CLASS______"></span> **=***class*   
Specifies the device setup class of the devices. The equal sign (**=**) identifies the string as a class name.

You can also specify hardware IDs, compatible IDs, device instance IDs, or ID patterns following the class name. Type a space between each ID or pattern. DevCon finds devices in the class that match the specified IDs.

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

The **DevCon DriverNodes** operation runs only on the local computer.

The **DevCon DriverNodes** operation is particularly useful for troubleshooting setup problems. For example, you can use it to determine whether a Windows INF file or a customized third-party INF file was used for a device.

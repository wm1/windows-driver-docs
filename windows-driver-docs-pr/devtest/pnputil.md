# PnPUtil


PnPUtil (PnPUtil.exe) is a command line tool that lets an administrator perform the following actions on [driver packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840):

-   Adds a driver package to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868).

-   Installs a driver package on the computer.

-   Deletes a driver package from the driver store.

-   Enumerates the driver packages that are currently in the driver store. Only driver packages that are not in-box packages are listed. An *in-box* driver package is one which is included in the default installation of Windows or its service packs.

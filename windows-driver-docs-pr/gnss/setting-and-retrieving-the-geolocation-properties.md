# Setting and retrieving the geolocation properties

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This documentation and the geolocation driver sample for Windows 8.1 has been deprecated.

When an application retrieves a particular property value, a corresponding property-retrieval method is called in the sample driver. For the simulated sensor, this would be **CGeolocation::GetPropertyValuesForGeolocationObject**. The Sensor API will pass the property keys for the properties requested by the application and the driver bundles the property values in an **IPortableDeviceValues** object which it returns to the API.

When an application writes, or updates, a property (such as change sensitivity or the desired accuracy), a corresponding property-write method is called in the sample driver. For the simulated sensor, this would be **CGeolocation::UpdateGeolocationPropertyValues**. This method is declared and defined in the sensor objectâ€™s files (Geolocation.h and Geolocation.cpp) and is invoked in the SensorDDI.cpp module.

For information about how the sensor properties are defined, see [Supporting the geolocation properties](supporting-the-geolocation-properties.md).

# Handling SRB\_FUNCTION\_RESET\_DEVICE

The ScsiPort driver no longer sends this SRB to its miniport drivers. Only Storport miniport drivers might have to handle this SRB.

If the HBA has the ability to reset a target device, as indicated when [*HwScsiFindAdapter*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300) sets up the [**PORT\_CONFIGURATION\_INFORMATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563900), the port driver requests a device reset when an uncompleted request times out.

The system port driver calls the miniport driver's *HwScsiStartIo* routine with an SRB in which the **Function** member is set to SRB\_FUNCTION\_RESET\_DEVICE. The miniport driver is responsible for completing any requests that are uncompleted on the device when it receives a reset-device request.

If the device reset fails or times out, or if the time-out occurs while the port driver is waiting for a **NextRequest** notification, the port driver calls [*HwScsiResetBus*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557318).

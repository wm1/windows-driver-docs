# FAQ on Custom Capabilities

## How are Custom Capabilities different from other capabilities?

1)  3rd party Microsoft partners can define new capabilities.

2)  They don't have to be built-in to Windows at compile time.

3)  App authorization to use the capability verifies during the app
    installation instead of when uploaded to the store.

## What is the best way to install a UWP app with Custom Capabilities?
The suggested method to install a UWP app with Custom Capabilities is to pre-install the app using DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management). For more information on DISM's see [DISM - Deployment Image Servicing and Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism---deployment-image-servicing-and-management-technical-reference-for-windows).
## What’s the difference between UWP apps with Custom Capabilities and DCA’s (Device Companion Apps)?

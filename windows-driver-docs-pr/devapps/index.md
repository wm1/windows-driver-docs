# Windows Store device apps


## <span id="purpose"></span>Purpose


Device manufacturers can create a Windows Store device app that serves as a companion to their device. Windows Store device apps have more capabilities than regular Windows Store apps and can perform privileged operations, such as firmware updates. Also, Windows Store device apps can start from AutoPlay (on more devices than other apps can), automatically install the first time a device is connected, and extend the printer and camera experiences built into Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

This section describes what Windows Store device apps are and how device manufacturers can create them. If you're new to Windows Store device apps, take a look at [Getting started](getting-started.md).

# Hardware access for Universal Windows Platform apps

## Overview

This section describes how to pair a device-specific [Universal Windows Platform
(UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)
application with a device on Windows 10.

After the app is installed, you can easily update it through the Windows Store.

To associate the UWP app with your device, you'll need to create a Custom Capability.

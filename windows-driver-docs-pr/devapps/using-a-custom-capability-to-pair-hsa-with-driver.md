# Using a custom capability to pair a Hardware Support App (HSA) with a driver

This topic describes how to associate your [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/50a5605e-3a91-41db-800a-9180717c1e86) app with a driver or [RPC (Remote Procedure Call)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378651) endpoint using a custom capability.  When paired in this fashion, the UWP app is referred to as a Hardware Support App (HSA).

The steps required by the owner of the driver or RPC endpoint are described in [Creating a custom capability to pair a driver with a Hardware Support App (HSA)](creating-a-custom-capability-to-pair-driver-with-hsa.md).

Before you get started, install the latest version of Visual Studio and create an UWP app project.  For more info, see [Develop Windows Store apps using Visual Studio](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop).

## Create a Windows Store account

A developer account on the Windows Store is required. Hardware partners will need a Windows Store account that is different from their Hardware partner account. You'll need the publisher name when you author the app manifest and the device metadata in later steps. You can also reserve a name for your app once you've created a store profile.

To create a Windows Store account, go to the [Windows Store apps sign up page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302197). For more info, see [Opening a developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account).

## Choosing a programming language for the app

If your app will communicate with a driver, you can use [Windows.Devices.Custom](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.custom), which is part of the WinRT API, and therefore available in JavaScript, C#, and C++.

If your app will communicate with an NT service, then you need to use the RPC APIs.  Because RPC APIs are Win32 APIs that are not available in WinRT, you need to either use C++, or wrap the RPC calls using .NET interop (PInvoke).  For more info, see [Calling Native Functions from Managed Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code).

## Contact the custom capability owner

Now you're ready to request access to a custom capability from a capability owner.  You'll need to gather the following info:

-   App PFN (Package Family Name) from the Windows Store
-   Name of the custom capability
-   Signature Hash of the app signing cert which can be generated from your .cer file using certutil.exe. The certificate must be SHA-256.

To generate the signature hash, run `C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe -dump CertificateName.cer`.

Look for the signature hash near the bottom and ensure it's SHA256.  Otherwise, use a SHA256 cert to sign your app.  The result should look like this:

```
Signature Hash:
ca9fc964db7e0c2938778f4559946833e7a8cfde0f3eaa07650766d4764e86c4
```

The capability owner uses this info to generate a [Signed custom capability Descriptor](creating-a-custom-capability-to-pair-driver-with-hsa.md) file and sends this file to the app developer.

The app developer can continue developing an app with custom capabilities in developer mode while waiting for the capability owner to approve the request. For example, use the following in the SCCD on a desktop PC in [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development):

-   Catalog entry in the SCCD.

    ```xml
    <Catalog>FFFF</Catalog>
    ```
-   Certificate Signature Hash in the authorized entity entry in the SCCD. While it is
    neither enforced nor validated, please put a 64-char sequence.

    ```xml
    <AuthorizedEntity AppPackageFamilyName="MicrosoftHSATest.Microsoft.SDKSamples.Hsa.CPP_q536wpkpf5cy2" CertificateSignatureHash="ca9fc964db7e0c2938778f4559946833e7a8cfde0f3eaa07650766d4764e86c4"></AuthorizedEntity>
    ```

## Add a custom capability to the App Package Manifest

Next, modify the app [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474) to include a capabilities attribute:

```xml
<Capabilities>
	<uap4:CustomCapability Name=”CompanyName.customCapabilityName_Publisher ID” />
</Capabilities>

```
Then copy the SCCD file to the package root of the appx package. In Visual Studio's solution explorer, right-click on “project-&gt; Add -&gt; Existing Item…” to add the SCCD to your project.

Finally, right click the project, select **Store**, then **Create App Packages**.

**Note**: There is no support for UWP apps with custom capabilities on mobile platforms.

## Troubleshooting

When the target machine is in Developer Mode, you can try the following steps to debug app registration failure:

1.	Remove the custom capability entry from your AppX manifest.
2.	Build your app and deploy it.
3.	In a PowerShell window, type `Get-AppxPackage`.
4.	Look for your app in the list and verify the exact package family name for your app.
5.	Update your SCCD with the package family name.
6.	Add the custom capability entry back into your AppX manifest.
7.	Rebuild and deploy.

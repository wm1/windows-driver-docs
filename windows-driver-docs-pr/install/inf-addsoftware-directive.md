# INF AddSoftware Directive

Each **AddSoftware** directive describes the installation of standalone software.  Use this directive in an INF file of the **SoftwareComponent** setup class. For more details on software components, see [Using a Component INF File](using-a-component-inf-file.md).  This directive is supported for Windows 10 version 1703 and later.

Valid installation types depend on the [target platform](../develop/windows-10-editions-for-universal-drivers.md). For example, Desktop supports MSI installers and setup EXEs.

When a software component INF file specifies **AddSoftware**, the system queues software to be installed after device installation.  There is no guarantee when or if the software will be installed.
If referenced software fails to install, the system tries again when the referencing software component is updated.

An **AddSoftware** directive is used within an [**INF *DDInstall*.Software**](inf-ddinstall-software-section.md) section.

```
[DDInstall.Software]

AddSoftware=SoftwareName,[flags],software-install-section
```

## Entries

*SoftwareName*

Specifies the name of the software to be installed.  This name uniquely identifies the software.  The processing of an **AddSoftware** directive checks the version against previous software installed with the same name by an **AddSoftware** directive from any driver package.  We recommend prefacing the SoftwareName with the vendor name, for example `ContosoControlPanel`.

*flags*

Specifies one or more (ORed) flags.  This value must be zero.

*software-install-section*

References an INF-writer-defined section that contains information for installing software.
	
## Remarks

Each INF-writer-created section name must be unique within the INF file and must follow the general rules for defining section names.  For more information about these rules, see [General Syntax Rules for INF Files](general-syntax-rules-for-inf-files.md).

An **AddSoftware** directive must reference a named *software-install-section* elsewhere in the INF file.  Each such section has the following form:

```
[software-install-section]

SoftwareType=type-code
[SoftwareBinary=path-to-binary]
[SoftwareArguments=argument[, argument] …]
[SoftwareVersion=w.x.y.z]
[SoftwareID=pfn://x.y.z]
```

The **SoftwareType** entry is required.  If **SoftwareType** is set to 1, **SoftwareBinary** and **SoftwareVersion** are also required, but arguments and flags are optional. If **SoftwareType** is set to 2, **SoftwareID** is required, and flags are optional.  For info about this feature, see [Pairing a driver with a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app](pairing-app-and-driver-versions.md) and [Creating a custom capability to pair a driver with a Hardware Support App (HSA)](../devapps/creating-a-custom-capability-to-pair-driver-with-hsa.md).

Any software installed using **AddSoftware** must be installed silently (or quietly). In other words, no user interface can be shown to the user during installation.    

## Software-Install Section Entries and Values

**SoftwareType**=*type-code*

Specifies the type of software installation.

A value of 1 indicates that the associated software is an MSI or EXE binary. When this value is set, the **SoftwareBinary** entry is also required. In current Windows Insiders builds, a value of 2 indicates that the associated software is a Windows Store link.

**SoftwareBinary**=*filename*

Specifies the path to the executable.  The system generates command lines like the following:

`MSI: msiexec /i "<SoftwareBinary>” ALLUSERS=1 /quiet /qn /promptrestart [<SoftwareArguments>]`

`EXE: <SoftwareBinary> [<SoftwareArguments>]`

If you use this entry, you must add the executable to the DriverStore by specifying the [INF CopyINF Directive](inf-copyfiles-directive.md) with  a **DestinationDirs** value of 13.

**SoftwareArguments**=*argument1[, argument2[, … argumentN]]*

Specifies extension-specific arguments to append to the command line.  You can specify command line arguments that the system simply passes through into the generated command line.  You can also specify special strings called *runtime context variables*.  When you specify a runtime context variable, the system converts it into a device-specific value before appending it to the generated command line.  You can mix and match literal string arguments with runtime context variables.  Supported runtime context variables are:

`<<DeviceInstanceID>>`

The system replaces the string above with the device instance ID of the software component.

For example:

```
	[DDInstall.Software]
	AddSoftware=ContosoControlPanel,,Contoso_ControlPanel_Software

	[Contoso_ControlPanel_Software]
	SoftwareType=1
	SoftwareBinary=ContosoControlPanel.exe
	SoftwareArguments=<<DeviceInstanceID>>
	SoftwareVersion=1.0.0.0
```

The above example results in a command line like this:

`<DriverStorePath>\ContosoControlPanel.exe PCI\VEN_0000&DEV_0001&SUBSYS_00000000&REV_00\0123`

If SoftwareArguments contains multiple arguments:

```
	SoftwareArguments=arg1,<<DeviceInstanceID>>,arg2
```

The above results in:

`<DriverStorePath>\ContosoControlPanel.exe arg1 PCI\VEN_0000&DEV_0001&SUBSYS_00000000&REV_00\0123 arg2`

**SoftwareVersion**=*w.x.y.z*

Specifies the software version.  Each value should not exceed 65535.  When the system encounters a duplicate **SoftwareName**, it checks the **SoftwareVersion** against the previous **SoftwareVersion**.  If it is greater, Windows runs the software.

**SoftwareID**=*x.y.z*

Specifies a Windows Store identifier and identifier type.  Currently, only Package Family Name (PFN) is supported.  Use a PFN to reference a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app using the form `pfn://<x.y.z>`.

# Modifying Registry Keys by Class Installers and Co-installers


**Note**  Features described in this section are not supported in universal or mobile driver packages. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

 

Except under certain conditions, [*class installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-class-installer) and [*co-installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-co-installer) should not use the standard registry functions to create, change, or delete registry keys. In most cases, registry keys should only be modified by using directives that are put in [INF files](inf-files.md). For more information about these directives, see [Summary of INF Directives](summary-of-inf-directives.md).

The following are exceptions to this rule:

-   When it is necessary, class installers and co-installers can use the standard registry functions to modify registry keys in the **HKLM\\Software** subtree.

    **Note**  We highly recommend that class installers and co-installers save custom device properties as entries within the device's [*software keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556336#wdkgloss-software-key).

     

-   Class installers and co-installers are permitted to modify subkeys in the **HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CoDeviceInstallers** registry key.

The following guidelines should be followed to safely modify registry keys by class installers or co-installers:

-   Class installers and co-installers must first use [**SetupDiCreateDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550973) or [**SetupDiOpenDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552079) to open handles to the registry keys that will be modified. After a handle has been opened, class installers and co-installers can use the standard registry functions to modify registry keys.

-   Class installers and co-installers must not use [**SetupDiDeleteDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550991) to delete [*software keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556336#wdkgloss-software-key) or [*hardware keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556288#wdkgloss-hardware-key) for the device. For more information, see [Deleting the Registry Keys of a Device](deleting-the-registry-keys-of-a-device.md).

For more information about the standard registry functions, see [Registry Functions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=194529).

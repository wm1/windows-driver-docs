# Modifying Registry Values by Class Installers and Co-installers


**Note**  Features described in this section are not supported in universal or mobile driver packages. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

 

Except under certain conditions, [*class installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-class-installer) and [*co-installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-co-installer) must not call the standard registry functions to create, change, or delete registry values that are reserved for use by the operating system.

The following are exceptions to this rule:

-   When it is necessary, class installers and co-installers can use the standard registry functions to modify registry values in the **HKLM\\Software** subtree.

    **Note**  We highly recommend that class installers and co-installers save custom device properties as entries within the device's [*software keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556336#wdkgloss-software-key).

     

-   Class installers and co-installers can modify the value of the [RunOnce registry key](runonce-registry-key.md). However, this value must consist of only calls to *Rundll32.exe*.

    Class installers and co-installers must follow the restrictions about how to use the [RunOnce registry key](runonce-registry-key.md) in [INF files](inf-files.md). In particular, this registry key must be used only for the installation of software-only devices that are enumerated by using the software device enumerator (SWENUM).

-   Class installers and co-installers can modify the **CoInstallers32** and **EnumPropPages32** registry values in the device?s [*software key*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556336#wdkgloss-software-key) when the installer handles [**DIF\_REGISTER\_COINSTALLERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543715) requests.

The following guidelines should be followed to safely modify registry values by class installers or co-installers:

-   Class installers and co-installers must first use [**SetupDiCreateDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550973) or [**SetupDiOpenDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552079) to open handles to the registry keys that will be modified. After a handle has been opened, class installers and co-installers can use the standard registry functions to modify registry values.

-   Class installers and co-installers must not use [**SetupDiDeleteDevRegKey**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550991) to delete [*software keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556336#wdkgloss-software-key) or [*hardware keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556288#wdkgloss-hardware-key) for the device. For more information, see [Deleting the Registry Keys of a Device](deleting-the-registry-keys-of-a-device.md).

# INF Ini2Reg Directive


**Note**  If you are building a universal or mobile driver package, this directive is not valid. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

 

An **Ini2Reg** directive references one or more named sections in which lines or sections from a supplied INI file are moved into the registry. This creates or replaces one or more value entries under a specified key.

```
        [
        DDInstall
        ] | 
[DDInstall.CoInstallers] | 
[ClassInstall32] | 
[ClassInstall32.ntx86] | 
[ClassInstall32.ntia64] |  (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)
[ClassInstall32.ntamd64]  (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)
  
Ini2Reg=ini-to-registry-section[,ini-to-registry-section]...
```

Each named section referenced by an **Ini2Reg** directive has the following form:

```
[ini-to-registry-section]
 
ini-file,ini-section,[ini-key],reg-root,subkey[,flags]
...
```

An *ini-to-registry-section* can have any INF-writer-determined number of entries, each on a separate line.

## Entries


<a href="" id="ini-file"></a>*ini-file*  
Specifies the name of an INI file supplied on the source media. This value can be expressed as a *filename* or as a %*strkey*% token that is defined in a [**Strings**](inf-strings-section.md) section of the INF file.

<a href="" id="ini-section"></a>*ini-section*  
Specifies the name of the section within the given INI file that contains the registry information to be copied.

<a href="" id="ini-key"></a>*ini-key*  
Specifies the name of the key in the INI file to copy to the registry. If this value is omitted, the whole *ini-section* is to be transferred to the specified registry *subkey*.

<a href="" id="reg-root"></a>*reg-root*  
Identifies the root of the registry tree for other values supplied in this entry. For specifics, see the reference for the [**AddReg directive**](inf-addreg-directive.md).

<a href="" id="subkey"></a>*subkey*  
Identifies the subkey to receive the value, expressed either as a %*strkey*% token defined in a [**Strings**](inf-strings-section.md) section of the INF or as an explicit registry path (*key1***\\***key2***\\***key3*...) from the given *reg-root*.

<a href="" id="flags"></a>*flags*  
Specifies (in bit 0) how to handle the INI file after transferring the given information to the registry and/or (in bit 1) whether to overwrite existing registry information, as follows:

<a href="" id="bit-zero---0"></a>Bit zero = **0**  
Do not remove the given information from the INI file after copying it into the registry. This is the default.

<a href="" id="bit-zero---1"></a>Bit zero = **1**  
Delete the given information from the INI file after moving it into the registry.

<a href="" id="bit-one---0"></a>Bit one = **0**  
If the specified subkey already exists in the registry, do not transfer the INI-supplied information into this *subkey*. Otherwise, create the specified *subkey* in the registry with this INI-supplied information as its value entry. This is the default.

<a href="" id="bit-one---1"></a>Bit one = **1**  
If the specified subkey already exists in the registry, replace its value entry with the INI-supplied information.

Remarks
-------

The **Ini2Reg** directive is valid in any of the sections shown in the formal syntax statement. This directive is also valid in INF-writer-defined sections referenced by an [**AddInterface**](inf-addinterface-directive.md) directive or referenced in an [**InterfaceInstall32**](inf-interfaceinstall32-section.md) section.

If an INF file is used to install devices on Windows XP and later versions of Windows, the INF file should not contain **Ini2Reg** directives. INF files that contain **Ini2Reg** directives will not pass ["Designed For Windows" logo testing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows-drivers/develop/testing_a_driver), will not receive a digital signature, and therefore will be untrusted by Windows (see [How Windows Selects Drivers](how-setup-selects-drivers.md)).

Each *ini-to-registry-section* name must be unique to the INF file. Each INF-writer-created section name must be unique within the INF file and must follow the general rules for defining section names. For more information about these rules, see [General Syntax Rules for INF Files](general-syntax-rules-for-inf-files.md).

The INF provides the full path of the given *ini-file* on the distribution media in one of the following ways:

-   In IHV/OEM-supplied INF files, by using the [**SourceDisksNames**](inf-sourcedisksnames-section.md) and, possibly, [**SourceDisksFiles**](inf-sourcedisksfiles-section.md) sections of this INF to explicitly specify the full path of each named source file that is not in the root directory (or directories) on the distribution media.
-   In system-supplied INF files, by supplying one or more additional INF files, identified in the **LayoutFile** entry in the [**Version**](inf-version-section.md) section of the INF file.

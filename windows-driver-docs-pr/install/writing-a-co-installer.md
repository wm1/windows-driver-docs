**Note**  Features described in this section are not supported in universal or mobile driver packages. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

 

A co-installer is a Microsoft Win32 DLL that assists in device installation. Co-installers are called by SetupAPI as "helpers" for Class Installers. For example, a vendor can provide a co-installer to write device-specific information to the registry that cannot be handled by the INF file.

This section includes the following topics:

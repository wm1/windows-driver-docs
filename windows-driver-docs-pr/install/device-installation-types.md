# Device Installation Types


Windows uses INF files to install a driver package on a computer or device. All Windows platforms support universal INF files, while only Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) supports legacy INF files.

## INF files for universal and mobile driver packages


If you are building a universal or mobile driver package, you must supply a universal INF file. Universal INFs contain only the subset of INF sections and directives that are required to install and configure a device. These directives can be performed on an offline system, without any runtime operations. For more information, see [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

## INF files for desktop driver packages


If you are building a desktop-only driver package, your INF file can use legacy, non-universal INF syntax.

Windows 10 for desktop editions continues to support legacy INF behavior, such as co-installers and class installers.

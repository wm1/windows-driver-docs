This section provides guidelines that [*class installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-class-installer) and [*co-installers*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556274#wdkgloss-co-installer) must follow when they access or modify registry keys and values. These guidelines are discussed in the following topics:

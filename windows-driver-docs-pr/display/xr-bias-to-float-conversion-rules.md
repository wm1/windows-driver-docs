# XR\_BIAS to Float Conversion Rules


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

The following code shows how to convert XR\_BIAS to float:

```
float XRtoFloat( UINT XRComponent ) {
// The & 0x3ff shows that only 10 bits contribute to the conversion. 
 return (float)( (XRComponent & 0x3ff) â€“ 0x180 ) / 510.f;
}
```

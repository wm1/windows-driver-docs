# Handling the E\_INVALIDARG Return Value


Typically, a user-mode display driver cannot fail any of its [functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570118) by returning E\_INVALIDARG. However, if the user-mode display driver receives the E\_INVALIDARG return value when it calls one of the [Microsoft Direct3D runtime-supplied functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552862) (because of a programming error in the driver or malicious code that runs in the operating system), the driver must return E\_INVALIDARG back to the Direct3D runtime after the runtime calls one of the driver's functions. Otherwise, the user-mode display driver should never return E\_INVALIDARG to the Direct3D runtime.

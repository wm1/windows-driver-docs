# Calling DisplayConfig functions for a Miracast target


To reduce compatibility issues of existing apps being exposed to new Miracast targets, the [**QueryDisplayConfig**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569215) and [**SetDisplayConfig**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569533) function implementations have ways for apps to find Miracast targets:

-   A value of **DISPLAYCONFIG\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY\_MIRACAST** in the [**DISPLAYCONFIG\_VIDEO\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554003) enumeration indicates that the VidPN target is a Miracast device.
-   The Flags parameter value of **QDC\_ALL\_PATHS** in a call to [**QueryDisplayConfig**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569215) won’t return any paths that connect to a Miracast target that does not have an active monitor attached.
-   For each path that has a connected Miracast monitor, [**QueryDisplayConfig**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569215) returns the connector type that’s reported by the Miracast sink. Internal Miracast sinks report a value of **DISPLAYCONFIG\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY\_MIRACAST** in the [**DISPLAYCONFIG\_VIDEO\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554003) enumeration. For example, if a Miracast sink reports that a TV is connected to the sink with a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) cable, then **QueryDisplayConfig** would report the target type as **DISPLAYCONFIG\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY\_HDMI**.
-   The [**DISPLAYCONFIG\_VIDEO\_SIGNAL\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554007) structure has a VSync frequency divider member, **vSyncFreqDivider**, that’s used similarly to [**D3DKMDT\_VIDEO\_SIGNAL\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546625).**vSyncFreqDivider**.
-   The [**DisplayConfigGetDeviceInfo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553903) function provides the base connector type for any target. In the case of a Miracast target, this function always returns a value of **DISPLAYCONFIG\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY\_MIRACAST** in the [**DISPLAYCONFIG\_VIDEO\_OUTPUT\_TECHNOLOGY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554003) enumeration.

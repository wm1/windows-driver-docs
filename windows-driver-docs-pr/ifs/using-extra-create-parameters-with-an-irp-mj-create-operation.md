# Using Extra Create Parameters with an IRP\_MJ\_CREATE Operation


Components of the operating system use extra create parameters (ECPs) to associate additional information with the [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630) operation on a file. Drivers can also use ECPs to process or associate additional information with the IRP\_MJ\_CREATE operation on a file in the following situations:

-   When a kernel-mode driver calls the [**FltCreateFileEx2**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541939) or [**IoCreateFileEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548283) routine to create or open the file

-   When a file system filter driver processes the [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630) operation for the file

The following sections describe how to define, attach, and use ECPs. The following sections also describe operating system-defined ECPs.

# Handling Quotas on IRP\_MJ\_CREATE

Some logic could also be included to acquire quota information if the file system supports quotas. One strategy a file system could adopt would be to acquire a block of quota information about [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630) that is later checked and updated by dispatch routines for other IRP requests that can change the size of a file (delete and write operations, for example).

# RX\_CONTEXT and IRP Management


## <span id="ddk_rx_context_and_irp_management_if"></span><span id="DDK_RX_CONTEXT_AND_IRP_MANAGEMENT_IF"></span>


The RX\_CONTEXT structure is one of the fundamental data structures used by RDBSS and network mini-redirectors to manage an I/O request packet (IRP). An RX\_CONTEXT structure describes an IRP while it is being processed and contains state information that allows global resources to be released as the IRP is completed. The RX\_CONTEXT data structure encapsulates an IRP for use by RDBSS, network mini-redirectors, and the file system. An RX\_CONTEXT structure includes a pointer to a single IRP and all of the context required to process the IRP.

An RX\_CONTEXT structure is sometimes referred to as an IRP Context or RxContext in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) header files and other resources used for developing network mini-redirector drivers.

The RX\_CONTEXT is a data structure to which additional information provided by the various network mini redirectors is attached. From a design standpoint, this additional information can be handled in one of several ways:

-   Allow for context pointers to be defined as part of RX\_CONTEXT, which network mini-redirectors use to store away their information. This implies that every time an RX\_CONTEXT structure is allocated and destroyed, the network mini-redirector driver must perform a separate associated allocation or destruction of the memory block that contains the additional network mini-redirector information. Since RX\_CONTEXT structures are created and destroyed in large numbers, this is not an acceptable solution from a performance standpoint.

-   Another approach consists of over allocating the size of each RX\_CONTEXT structure by a pre-specified amount for each network mini redirector, which is then reserved for use by the mini redirector. Such an approach avoids the additional allocation and destruction but complicates the RX\_CONTEXT management code in RDBSS.

-   The third approach consists of allocating a pre-specified area, which is the same for all network mini redirectors as part of each RX\_CONTEXT. This is an unformatted area on top of which any desired structure can be imposed by the various network mini redirectors. Such an approach overcomes the disadvantages associated with previous approaches. This is the approach currently implemented in RDBSS.

The third approach is the scheme used by RDBSS. Consequently, developers of network mini-redirector drivers should try and define the associated private context to fit into this pre-specified area defined in the RX\_CONTEXT data structure. Network mini-redirector drivers that violate this rule will incur a significant performance penalty.

Many RDBSS routines and routines exported by a network mini-redirector make reference to RX\_CONTEXT structures in either the initiating thread or in some other thread used by the routine. Thus, the RX\_CONTEXT structures are reference counted to manage their use for asynchronous operations. When the reference count goes to zero, the RX\_CONTEXT structure can be finalized and released on the last dereference operation.

RDBSS provides a number of routines that are used to manipulate an RX\_CONTEXT structure and the associated IRP. These routines are used to allocate, initialize, and delete an RX\_CONTEXT structure. These routines are also used to complete the IRP associated with an RX\_CONTEXT and set up a cancel routine for an RX\_CONTEXT.

The following routines manipulate RX\_CONTEXT structures:

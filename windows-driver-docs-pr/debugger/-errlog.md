Remarks
-------

This command displays information about any pending events in the I/O system's error log. These are events queued by calls to the [**IoWriteErrorLogEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550527) function, to be written to the system's event log for subsequent viewing by the **Event Viewer**.

Only entries that were queued by [**IoWriteErrorLogEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550527) but have not been committed to the error log will be displayed.

This command can be used as a diagnostic aid after a system crash because it reveals pending error information that was unable to be committed to the error log before the system halted.

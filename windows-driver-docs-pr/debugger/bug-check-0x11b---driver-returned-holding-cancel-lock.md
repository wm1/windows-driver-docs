# Bug Check 0x11B: DRIVER\_RETURNED\_HOLDING\_CANCEL\_LOCK


The DRIVER\_RETURNED\_HOLDING\_CANCEL\_LOCK bug check has a value of 0x0000011B. This bug check indicates that a driver has returned from a *cancel* routine that holds the global cancel lock. This causes all later cancellation calls to fail, and results in either a deadlock or another bug check.

Remarks
-------

The cancel spin lock should have been released by the *cancel* routine.

The driver calls the IoCancelIrpIoCancelIrp function to cancel an individual I/O request packet (IRP). This function acquires the cancel spin lock, sets the cancel flag in the IRP, and then calls the *cancel* routine specified by the appropriate field in the IRP, if a routine was specified. The *cancel* routine is expected to release the cancel spin lock. If there is no *cancel* routine, the cancel spin lock is released.

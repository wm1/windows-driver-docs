# KdSrv Command-Line Options


The KdSrv command line uses the following syntax.

```
kdsrv -t ServerTransport 
```

## <span id="ddk_kdsrv_command_line_options_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_KDSRV_COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______-t_______ServerTransport______"></span><span id="_______-t_______servertransport______"></span><span id="_______-T_______SERVERTRANSPORT______"></span> **-t** *ServerTransport*   
Specifies the transport protocol. For a list of the possible protocols and the syntax for *ServerTransport* in each case, see [**Activating a KD Connection Server**](activating-a-kd-connection-server.md).

If you type **kdsrv** with no parameters, a message box with help text appears.

For information about using KdSrv, see [KD Connection Servers (Kernel Mode)](kd-connection-servers--kernel-mode-.md).

# .restart (Restart Target Application)


The **.restart** command restarts the target application.

Do not confuse this command with the [**.restart (Restart Kernel Connection)**](-restart--restart-kernel-connection-.md) command, which works only in kernel mode.

```
.restart 
```

Remarks
-------

CDB and WinDbg can restart a target application if the debugger originally created the application. You can use the **.restart** command even if the target application has already closed.

However, if the application is running and the debugger is later attached to the process, the **.restart** command has no effect.

After the process is restarted, it immediately breaks into the debugger.

In WinDbg, use the [View | WinDbg Command Line](view---windbg-command-line.md) command if you started your target from the WinDbg command prompt and you want to review this command line before you decide whether to use **.restart**.

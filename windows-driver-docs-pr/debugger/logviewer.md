# LogViewer

The LogViewer utility can manipulate an .lgv file, which is a compressed log file produced by the Logger tool. To load a file, simply launch Logviewer.exe through Windows Explorer or from a Command Prompt window. It will take a moment to parse the manifest files. Once this is complete, you can invoke **File | Open** and select the desired .lgv file.

Once LogViewer has opened an .lgv file, it will display a list of all functions in the order they were logged. LogViewer supports powerful commands to filter out functions that you are not interested in. It can also save a filtered version of the log file as a text file.

This section includes:

[Filtering the LogViewer Function List](filtering-the-logviewer-function-list.md)

[Exporting LogViewer Files to Text](exporting-logviewer-files-to-text.md)

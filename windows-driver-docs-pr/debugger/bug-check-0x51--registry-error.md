Cause
-----

Something has gone wrong with the registry. If a kernel debugger is available, get a stack trace.

This error may indicate that the registry encountered an I/O error while trying to read one of its files. This can be caused by hardware problems or file system corruption.

It may also occur due to a failure in a refresh operation, which is used only in by the security system, and then only when resource limits are encountered.

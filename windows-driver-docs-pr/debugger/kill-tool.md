<span id="________f______"></span><span id="________F______"></span> **/f**   
Forces the termination of the process without prompting the user for confirmation. This option is required to terminate a protected process, such as a system service.

<span id="_______PID______"></span><span id="_______pid______"></span> *PID*   
Specifies the process identifier (PID) of the task to be terminated.

To find the PID for a task, use TaskList in Microsoft Windows XP and later or [TList](tlist.md) in Windows 2000.

<span id="_______Pattern_"></span><span id="_______pattern_"></span><span id="_______PATTERN_"></span> *Pattern***\***  
Specifies all or part of the name of a task or window. The Kill tool terminates all processes whose process names or window names match the pattern. The asterisk is required.

Before using a pattern that might match many process or window names unintentionally, use the **tlist** *pattern* command to test the pattern. See [TList](tlist.md) for details.

## <span id="Examples"></span><span id="examples"></span><span id="EXAMPLES"></span>Examples


The following command terminates processes whose names begin with "myapp."

```
kill myapp*
```

The following command terminates the process whose process ID (PID) is 2520:

```
kill 2520
```

The following command terminates processes whose names begin with "my\*." It does not prompt for confirmation. This command succeeds even when this process is a system service:

```
kill /f my*
```

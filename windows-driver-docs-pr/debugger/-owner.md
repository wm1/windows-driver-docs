Remarks
-------

If no parameters are used and a fault has occurred, **!owner** will display the name of the owner of the faulting module or function.

When you pass a module or function name to the **!owner** extension, the debugger displays the word **Followup** followed by the name of owner of the specified module or function.

For this extension to display useful information, you must first create a triage.ini file containing the names of the module and function owners.

For details on the triage.ini file and an example of the **!owner** extension, see [Specifying Module and Function Owners](specifying-module-and-function-owners.md).

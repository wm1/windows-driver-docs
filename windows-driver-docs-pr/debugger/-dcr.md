Remarks
-------

The DCR specifies default parameters for the processor status register values on interruption. The DCR also specifies some additional global controls, as well as whether or not speculative load faults can be deferred.

Here are a couple of examples:

```
kd> !dcr @dcr
dcr:pp be lc dm dp dk dx dr da dd
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

kd> !dcr @dcr 2

  pp : 1 : Privileged Performance Monitor Default
  be : 0 : Big-Endian Default
  lc : 1 : IA-32 Lock check Enable
  rv : 0 : reserved1
  dm : 1 : Defer TLB Miss faults only
  dp : 1 : Defer Page Not Present faults only
  dk : 1 : Defer Key Miss faults only
  dx : 1 : Defer Key Permission faults only
  dr : 1 : Defer Access Rights faults only
  da : 1 : Defer Access Bit faults only
  dd : 0 : Defer Debug faults only
  rv : 0 : reserved2
```

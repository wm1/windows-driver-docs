# Bug Check 0xF1: SCSI\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION


The SCSI\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION bug check has a value of 0x000000F1. This is the bug check code for all Driver Verifier **SCSI Verification** violations.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

## SCSI\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION Parameters


Parameter 1 identifies the type of violation.

Cause
-----

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for an explanation of the cause.

Resolution
----------

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might consider removing the driver which caused this problem as well.

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

The Driver Verifier **SCSI Verification** option is available only in Windows XP and later. The Driver Verifier **Storport Verification** option is available only in Windows 7 and later. For full details on Driver Verifier, see the Windows Driver Kit.

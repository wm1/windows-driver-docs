# MASM Numbers and Operators


## <span id="ddk_masm_numbers_and_operators_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_MASM_NUMBERS_AND_OPERATORS_DBG"></span>


Before version 4.0 of the Debugging Tools for Windows package, NTSD, CDB, KD, and WinDbg used only Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) expression syntax.

### <span id="numbers_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="NUMBERS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Numbers in MASM Expressions

You can put numbers in MASM expressions in base 16, 10, 8, or 2.

Use the [**n (Set Number Base)**](n--set-number-base-.md) command to set the default radix to 16, 10, or 8. All unprefixed numbers are then interpreted in this base. You can override the default radix by specifying the **0x** prefix (hexadecimal), the **0n** prefix (decimal), the **0t** prefix (octal), or the **0y** prefix (binary).

You can also specify hexadecimal numbers by adding an **h** after the number. You can use uppercase or lowercase letters within numbers. For example, "0x4AB3", "0X4aB3", "4AB3h", "4ab3h", and "4aB3H" have the same meaning.

If you do not add a number after the prefix in an expression, the number is read as 0. Therefore, you can write 0 as 0, the prefix followed by 0, and only the prefix. For example, in hexadecimal, "0", "0x0", and "0x" have the same meaning.

You can enter hexadecimal 64-bit values in the **xxxxxxxx\`xxxxxxxx** format. You can also omit the grave accent (\`). If you include the grave accent, [automatic sign extension](sign-extension.md) is disabled.

### <span id="symbols_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="SYMBOLS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Symbols in MASM Expressions

In MASM expressions, the numeric value of any symbol is its memory address. Depending on what the symbol refers to, this address is the address of a global variable, local variable, function, segment, module, or any other recognized label.

To specify which module the address is associated with, include the module name and an exclamation point (!) before the name of the symbol. If the symbol could be interpreted as a hexadecimal number, include the module name and an exclamation point, or just an exclamation point, before the symbol name. For more information about symbol recognition, see [Symbol Syntax and Symbol Matching](symbol-syntax-and-symbol-matching.md).

Use two colons (::) or two underscores (\_\_) to indicate the members of a class.

Use a grave accent (\`) or an apostrophe (') in a symbol name only if you add a module name and exclamation point before the symbol.

### <span id="numeric_operators_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="NUMERIC_OPERATORS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Numeric Operators in MASM Expressions

You can modify any component of an expression by using a unary operator. You can combine any two components by using a binary operator. Unary operators take precedence over binary operators. When you use multiple binary operators, the operators follow the fixed precedence rules that are described in the following tables.

You can always use parentheses to override precedence rules.

If part of an MASM expression is enclosed in parentheses and two at signs (@@) appear before the expression, the expression is interpreted according to [C++ expression rules](c---numbers-and-operators.md). You cannot add a space between the two at signs and the opening parenthesis. You can also specify the [expression evaluator](evaluating-expressions.md) by using **@@c++( ... )** or **@@masm( ... )**.

When you perform arithmetic computations, the MASM expression evaluator treats all numbers and symbols as ULONG64 types.

Unary address operators assume DS as the default segment for addresses. Expressions are evaluated in order of operator precedence. If adjacent operators have equal precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

You can use the following unary operators.

You can use the following binary operators. The operators in each cell take precedence over those in lower cells. Operators in the same cell are of the same precedence and are parsed from left to right.

The &lt;, &gt;, =, ==, and != comparison operators evaluate to 1 if the expression is true or zero if the expression is false. A single equal sign (=) is the same as a double equal sign (==). You cannot use side effects or assignments within a MASM expression.

An invalid operation (such as division by zero) results in an "Operand error" is returned to the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md).

### <span id="non_numeric_operators_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="NON_NUMERIC_OPERATORS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Non-Numeric Operators in MASM Expressions

You can also use the following additional operators in MASM expressions.

<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Operator</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$fnsucc(</strong><em>FnAddress</em>, <em>RetVal</em>, <em>Flag</em><strong>)</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Interprets the <em>RetVal</em> value as a return value for the function that is located at the <em>FnAddress</em> address. If this return value qualifies as a success code, <strong>$fnsucc</strong> returns <strong>TRUE</strong>. Otherwise, <strong>$fnsucc</strong> returns <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>
<p>If the return type is BOOL, bool, HANDLE, HRESULT, or NTSTATUS, <strong>$fnsucc</strong> correctly understands whether the specified return value qualifies as a success code. If the return type is a pointer, all values other than <strong>NULL</strong> qualify as success codes. For any other type, success is defined by the value of <em>Flag</em>. If <em>Flag</em> is 0, a nonzero value of <em>RetVal</em> is success. If <em>Flag</em> is 1, a zero value of <em>RetVal</em> is success.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$iment (</strong><em>Address</em><strong>)</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Returns the address of the image entry point in the loaded module list. <em>Address</em> specifies the Portable Executable (PE) image base address. The entry is found by looking up the image entry point in the PE image header of the image that <em>Address</em> specifies.</p>
<p>You can use this function for both modules that are already in the module list and to set [unresolved breakpoints](unresolved-breakpoints---bu-breakpoints-.md) by using the [<strong>bu</strong>](bp--bu--bm--set-breakpoint-.md) command.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$scmp(&quot;</strong><em>String1</em><strong>&quot;, &quot;</strong><em>String2</em><strong>&quot;)</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Evaluates to -1, 0, or 1, like the <strong>strcmp</strong> C function.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$sicmp(&quot;</strong><em>String1</em><strong>&quot;, &quot;</strong><em>String2</em><strong>&quot;)</strong></p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$spat(&quot;</strong><em>String</em><strong>&quot;, &quot;</strong><em>Pattern</em><strong>&quot;)</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Evaluates to <strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong> depending on whether <em>String</em> matches <em>Pattern</em>. The matching is case-insensitive. <em>Pattern</em> can contain a variety of wildcard characters and specifiers. For more information about the syntax, see [String Wildcard Syntax](string-wildcard-syntax.md).</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>$vvalid(</strong><em>Address</em><strong>,</strong> <em>Length</em><strong>)</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Determines whether the memory range that begins at <em>Address</em> and extends for <em>Length</em> bytes is valid. If the memory is valid, <strong>$vvalid</strong> evaluates to 1. If the memory is invalid, <strong>$vvalid</strong> evaluates to 0.</p></td>

### <span id="registers_and_pseudo_registers_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="REGISTERS_AND_PSEUDO_REGISTERS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Registers and Pseudo-Registers in MASM Expressions

You can use registers and pseudo-registers within MASM expressions. You can add an at sign (@) before all registers and pseudo-registers. The at sign causes the debugger to access the value more quickly. This at sign is unnecessary for the most common x86-based registers. For other registers and pseudo-registers, we recommend that you add the at sign, but it is not actually required. If you omit the at sign for the less common registers, the debugger tries to parse the text as a hexadecimal number, then as a symbol, and finally as a register.

You can also use a period (.) to indicate the current instruction pointer. You should not add an at sign before this period, and you cannot use a period as the first parameter of the [**r command**](r--registers-.md). This period has the same meaning as the **$ip** pseudo-register.

For more information about registers and pseudo-registers, see [Register Syntax](register-syntax.md) and [Pseudo-Register Syntax](pseudo-register-syntax.md).

### <span id="source_line_numbers_in_masm_expressions"></span><span id="SOURCE_LINE_NUMBERS_IN_MASM_EXPRESSIONS"></span>Source Line Numbers in MASM Expressions

You can use source file and line number expressions within MASM expressions. You must enclose these expressions by using grave accents (\`). For more information about the syntax, see [Source Line Syntax](source-line-syntax.md).

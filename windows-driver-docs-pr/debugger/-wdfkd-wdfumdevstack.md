# !wdfkd.wdfumdevstack


The **!wdfkd.wdfumdevstack** extension displays detailed information about a UMDF device stack in the [implicit process](controlling-threads-and-processes.md).

```
!wdfkd.wdfumdevstack DevstackAddress [Flags] 
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______DevstackAddress______"></span><span id="_______devstackaddress______"></span><span id="_______DEVSTACKADDRESS______"></span> *DevstackAddress*   
Specifies the address of the device stack to display information about. You can use [**!wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks**](-wdfkd-wdfumdevstacks.md) to get the addresses of UMDF device stacks in the implicit process.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Optional. Specifies the type of information to be displayed. *Flags* can be any combination of the following bits. The default value is 0x01.

<span id="Bit_0__0x01_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x01_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X01_"></span>Bit 0 (0x01)  
Displays detailed information about the device stack.

<span id="Bit_7__0x80_"></span><span id="bit_7__0x80_"></span><span id="BIT_7__0X80_"></span>Bit 7 (0x80)  
Displays information about the internal framework.

Remarks
-------

You can use this command in a kernel-mode debugging session or in a user-mode debugging session that is attached to the UMDF host process (wudfhost.exe).

This command displays the same information as the user-mode command [**!wudfext.umdevstack**](-wudfext-umdevstack.md).

Here is an example of how to use **!wdfumdevstack**. First use [**!wdfumdevstacks**](-wdfkd-wdfumdevstacks.md) to display the UMDF device stacks in the implicit process.

```
0: kd> !wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks
Number of device stacks: 1
  Device Stack: 0x000000a5a3ab5f70     Pdo Name: \Device\00000052
    Active: Yes
    Number of UM devices: 1
    Device 0
      Driver Config Registry Path: MyUmdf2Driver
      UMDriver Image Path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\UMDF\MyUmdf2Driver.dll
      FxDriver: 0xa5a3acaaa0
      FxDevice: 0xa5a3ac4fc0
      Open UM files (use !wdfumfile <addr> for details): <None>
      Device XFerMode: Deferred RW: Buffered CTL: Buffered
      DevStack XFerMode: Deferred RW: Buffered CTL: Buffered
```

The preceding output shows that there is one UMDF device stack in the implicit process. You can also see that the device stack has one device object (Number of UM devices: 1).

The preceding output displays the address of a device stack (0x000000a5a3ab5f70). To get detailed information about the device stack, pass its address to **!wdfumdevstack**. In this example, we set the *Flags* parameter to 0x80 to include information about the framework.

```

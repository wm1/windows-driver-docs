Cause
-----

Any part of the disk subsystem can cause the PROCESS1\_INITIALIZATION\_FAILED bug check, including bad disks, bad or incorrect cables, mixing different ATA-type devices on the same chain, or drives that are not available becuase of hardware regeneration.

This bug check can also be caused by a missing file from the boot partition or by a driver file that a user accidentally disabled in the **Drivers** tab.

# !wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks


The **!wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks** extension displays information about all UMDF device stacks in the [implicit process](controlling-threads-and-processes.md).

```
!wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks [Flags] 
```

Remarks
-------

You can use this command in a kernel-mode debugging session or in a user-mode debugging session that is attached to the UMDF host process (wudfhost.exe).

This command displays the same information as the user-mode command [**!wudfext.umdevstacks**](-wudfext-umdevstacks.md).

Before you use this command, use [**!process**](-process.md) to get a list of all UMDF host processes.

```
0: kd> !process 0 0 wudfhost.exe
PROCESS ffffe00000c32900
    SessionId: 0  Cid: 079c    Peb: 7ff782537000  ParentCid: 037c
    DirBase: 607af000  ObjectTable: ffffc00009807940  HandleCount: <Data Not Accessible>
    Image: WUDFHost.exe
```

The preceding output shows that there is one UMDF host process; that is, there is one instance of wudfhost.exe.

Next use [**.process**](-process--set-process-context-.md) to set the implicit process to wudfhost.exe.

```
0: kd> .process /P ffffe00000c32900
Implicit process is now ffffe000`00c32900
.cache forcedecodeptes done
```

Now use **!wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks** to display the UMDF device stacks in the implicit process (wudfhost.exe).

```
0: kd> !wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks
Number of device stacks: 1
  Device Stack: 0x000000a5a3ab5f70     Pdo Name: \Device\00000052
    Active: Yes
    Number of UM devices: 1
    Device 0
      Driver Config Registry Path: MyUmdf2Driver
      UMDriver Image Path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\UMDF\MyUmdf2Driver.dll
      FxDriver: 0xa5a3acaaa0
      FxDevice: 0xa5a3ac4fc0
      Open UM files (use !wdfumfile <addr> for details): <None>
      Device XFerMode: Deferred RW: Buffered CTL: Buffered
      DevStack XFerMode: Deferred RW: Buffered CTL: Buffered
```

The preceding output shows that there is one UMDF device stack in the implicit process. You can also see that the device stack has one device object (Number of UM devices: 1).

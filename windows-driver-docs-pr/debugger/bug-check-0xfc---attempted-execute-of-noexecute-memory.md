Resolution
----------

When possible, the Unicode string of the driver name that attempted to execute non-executable memory is printed on the bug check screen and is also saved in **KiBugCheckDriver**. Otherwise, the driver in question can often be found by running a stack trace and then reviewing the current instruction pointer.

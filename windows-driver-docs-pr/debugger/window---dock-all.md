# Window | Dock All

Click **Dock All** on the **Window** menu to dock all of the floating windows, except for those with **Always floating** selected on their shortcut menus.

WinDbg automatically positions each floating window. If a window has never been docked before, WinDbg moves it to a new untabbed location. If a window has been docked before, WinDbg moves it to its most recent docking location, which might be either tabbed or untabbed.

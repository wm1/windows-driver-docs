# Writing New Debugger Extensions


## <span id="ddk_writing_new_debugger_extensions_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_WRITING_NEW_DEBUGGER_EXTENSIONS_DBG"></span>


You can create your own debugging commands by writing an extension DLL. For example, you might want to write a command to display a complex data structure, or a command that will stop and start the target depending on the value of certain variables or memory locations.

There are two different types of debugger extensions:

-   *DbgEng extensions*. These are based on the prototypes in the dbgeng.h header file, and also those in the wdbgexts.h header file.

-   *WdbgExts extensions*. These are based on the prototypes in the wdbgexts.h header file alone.

For information about how to write debugger extensions, see [Writing DbgEng Extensions](writing-dbgeng-extensions.md) and [Writing WdbgExts Extensions](writing-wdbgexts-extensions.md).

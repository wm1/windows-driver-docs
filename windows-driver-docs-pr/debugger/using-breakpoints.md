# Using Breakpoints


A *breakpoint* is a location in executable code at which the operating system stops execution and breaks into the debugger. This allows you to analyze the target and issue debugger commands.

This section includes the following topics:

[Methods of Controlling Breakpoints](methods-of-controlling-breakpoints.md)

[Breakpoint Syntax](breakpoint-syntax.md)

[Unresolved Breakpoints (bu Breakpoints)](unresolved-breakpoints---bu-breakpoints-.md)

[Processor Breakpoints (ba Breakpoints)](processor-breakpoints---ba-breakpoints-.md)

[Initial Breakpoint](initial-breakpoint.md)

[User Space and System Space](user-space-and-system-space.md)

[Risks Entailed When Setting Breakpoints](risks-entailed-when-setting-breakpoints.md)

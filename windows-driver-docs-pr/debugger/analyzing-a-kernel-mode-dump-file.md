Regardless of which tool you use, you need to install the symbol files for the version of Windows that generated the dump file. These files will be used by the debugger you choose to use to analyze the dump file. For more information about the proper installation of symbol files, see [Installing Windows Symbol Files](installing-windows-symbol-files.md).

The DumpExam tool is obsolete. It is no longer needed in the analysis of a crash dump file.

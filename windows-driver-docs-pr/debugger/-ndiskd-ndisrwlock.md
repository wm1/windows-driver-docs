# !ndiskd.ndisrwlock


The **!ndiskd.ndisrwlock** extension displays information about an [**NDIS\_RW\_LOCK\_EX**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567279) lock structure.

```
!ndiskd.ndisrwlock [-handle <x>] 
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters

Required. Handle of the lock structure.

Ndiskd.dll

Examples
--------

Use the **!ndiskd.ndisrwlock** extension if you create your own RW lock and would want to inspect it. To obtain the handle for an RW lock, use the *poi* command to dereference the address of your driver's lock. The following snippet shows how to look at a lock that the TCIPIP protocol was using at the time of the example.

```
0: kd> !ndiskd.ndisrwlock poi(tcpip!gAleHashtableLock)


NDIS READ-WRITE LOCK

    Allocated by       [NDIS generic object]
    Exclusive access   Not acquired
    Read-only access   0 references

    Set a breakpoint on acquire/release
```

To observe the driver using this RW lock, click on the "Set a breakpoint on acquire/release" link at the bottom of the RW lock's details. After setting the breakpoint, enter the **g** command to let the debugee machine run and hit the breakpoint.

```
0: kd> ba r4 ffffe00bc3fc22f8
0: kd> g
Breakpoint 0 hit
nt!KeTestSpinLock+0x3:
fffff802`0d69eb53 4885c0          test    rax,rax
```

Now you can re-run the same **!ndiskd.ndisrwlock** command to see that this RW lock has one Read-only access reference.

```
0: kd> !ndiskd.ndisrwlock poi(tcpip!gAleHashtableLock)


NDIS READ-WRITE LOCK

    Allocated by       [NDIS generic object]
    Exclusive access   Not acquired
    Read-only access   1 reference

    Set a breakpoint on acquire/release
```

# Reading Symbols from Paged-Out Headers


## <span id="ddk_reading_symbols_from_paged_out_headers_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_READING_SYMBOLS_FROM_PAGED_OUT_HEADERS_DBG"></span>


The kernel debugger must read the header for each loaded module's image in order to know which symbols correspond to that module.

If a module's header is paged out to disk, the debugger will not load symbols for this module. If this happens with a module that is essential to the debugging process, it can be a critical problem.

The following procedure can be used to solve this problem.

**To acquire symbols for paged-out headers**

1.  Make a second copy of the kernel itself. It is probably easiest to put this on a network share.

2.  Append the root directory of this share to the symbol path. See [Symbol Path](symbol-path.md) for the ways to change the symbol path.

3.  Use the [**.reload (Reload Module)**](-reload--reload-module-.md) command.

4.  Use the [**!sym noisy**](-sym.md) extension command to see more verbose output. If this is used, you will be able to see which symbols are loaded from the module images on the target computer, and which are loaded from the copy of the kernel modules.

This technique must be used with care, since the debugger has no way of verifying whether the file copies actually match the originals. So it is crucial that the version of Windows used on the network share matches the version used on the target computer.

This technique is only used for kernel-mode debugging. The operating system is capable of paging in any headers required during user-mode debugging (unless the disk holding the paging file is dismounted or otherwise inaccessible).

Here is an example of this technique being used:

```
kd> .reload

.......
Loading unloaded module list
..............
Loading User Symbols

by being in the wrong process context or by paging
```

Notice that many images have inaccessible headers. Check the symbols from one of these files (in this example, fs\_rec.sys):

```
kd> x fs_rec!*
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for fs_rec.sys
```

These headers are apparently paged out. So you need to add the proper images to the symbol path:

```
kd> .sympath+ \\myserver\myshare\symbols\x86fre\symbols
Symbol search path is: symsrv*symsrv.dll*c:\localcache*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;\\myserver\myshare\symbols\x86fre\symbols

kd> .reload

The same warnings have appeared, but the symbols themselves are now accessible:

```

fe0c8310  Fs_Rec!_imp__IoCreateDevice

```

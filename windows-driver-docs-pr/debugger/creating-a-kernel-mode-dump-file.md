# Creating a Kernel-Mode Dump File


## <span id="ddk_creating_a_kernel_mode_dump_file_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CREATING_A_KERNEL_MODE_DUMP_FILE_DBG"></span>


There are three ways in which a kernel-mode dump file can be created:

1.  You can enable the dump file from the Control Panel, and then the system can crash on its own.

2.  You can enable the dump file from the Control Panel, and then force the system to crash.

3.  You can use the debugger to create a dump file without crashing the system.

This section includes:

[Enabling a Kernel-Mode Dump File](enabling-a-kernel-mode-dump-file.md)

[Forcing a System Crash](forcing-a-system-crash.md)

[Creating a Dump File Without a System Crash](creating-a-dump-file-without-a-system-crash.md)

[Verifying the Creation of a Kernel-Mode Dump File](verifying-the-creation-of-a-kernel-mode-dump-file.md)

It is also possible to use an NMI switch to create a crash dump file. Contact your hardware vendor to determine whether your machine has this switch.

The usage of NMI switches is not covered in this documentation.

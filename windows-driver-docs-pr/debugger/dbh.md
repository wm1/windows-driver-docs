# DBH


The DBH tool (dbh.exe) is a command-line tool that displays information about the contents of a symbol file.

DBH exposes the functionality of the DbgHelp API (dbghelp.dll) through a convienient command-line interface. Therefore, its behavior may change as DbgHelp is updated. The source code for one version of DBH is available in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8.

This section includes:

[Using DBH](using-dbh.md)

[Additional DBH Examples](additional-dbh-examples.md)

[**DBH Command-Line Options**](dbh-command-line-options.md)

[DBH Commands](dbh-commands.md)

For more information about the DbgHelp API, see the Debug Help Library documentation, which is installed as part of Debugging Tools for Windows if you perform a custom install and select the **SDK** feature and its subfeatures.

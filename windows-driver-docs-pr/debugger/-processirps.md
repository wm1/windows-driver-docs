# !processirps


The **!processirps** extension displays information about I/O request packets (IRPs) associated with processes.

```
!processirps
!processirps ProcessAddress [Flags]
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="_ProcessAddress"></span><span id="_processaddress"></span><span id="_PROCESSADDRESS"></span> **** *ProcessAddress*  
The address of a process. If you specify *ProcessAddress*, only IRPs associated with that process are displayed. If you do not specify *ProcessAddress*, IRPs for all processes are displayed.

<span id="_Flags"></span><span id="_flags"></span><span id="_FLAGS"></span> **** *Flags*  
A bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags.

<span id="Bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X1_"></span>Bit 0 (0x1)  
Display IRPs queued to threads.

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
Display IRPs queued to file objects.

If you specify *Flags*, you must also specify *ProcessAddress*. If you do not specify *Flags*, IRPs queued to both threads and file objects are displayed.

kdexts.dll

Remarks
-------

This command enables you to quickly identify any queued IRPs for a process, both those that are queued to threads and those that are queued to file objects. IRPs are queued to a file object when the file object has a completion port associated with it.

Examples
--------

You can use [**!process**](-process.md) command to get process addresses. For example, you could get the process address for explorer.exe.

```
2: kd> !process 0 0
**** NT ACTIVE PROCESS DUMP ****
...
PROCESS fffffa800688c940
    SessionId: 1  Cid: 0bbc    Peb: 7f70da5e000  ParentCid: 0b84
    DirBase: 2db10000  ObjectTable: fffff8a0025bd440  HandleCount: 1056.
    Image: explorer.exe
```

Now you can pass the process address for explorer.exe to the **!processirps** command. The following output shows that explorer.exe has IRPs queued to threads and IRPs queued to file objects.

```
2: kd> !processirps fffffa800688c940
**** PROCESS fffffa800688c940 (Image: explorer.exe) ****

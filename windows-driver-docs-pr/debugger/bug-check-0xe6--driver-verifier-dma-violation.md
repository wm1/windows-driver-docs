# Bug Check 0xE6: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DMA\_VIOLATION


The DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DMA\_VIOLATION bug check has a value of 0x000000E6. This is the bug check code for all Driver Verifier **DMA Verification** violations.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

## DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DMA\_VIOLATION Parameters


Parameter 1 is the only parameter of interest. This parameter identifies the exact violation. If a debugger is attached, an informative message is displayed in the debugger.

Cause
-----

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause.

Resolution
----------

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

The Driver Verifier **DMA Verification** option is only available in Windows XP and later versions. For full details on Driver Verifier, see the Windows Driver Kit.

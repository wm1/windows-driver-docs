# UMDH Commands


## <span id="ddk_umdh_commands_dtools"></span><span id="DDK_UMDH_COMMANDS_DTOOLS"></span>


UMDH has two different modes, each with its own command syntax and parameters:

-   [**Analyze a Running Process**](analyze-a-running-process.md) - Displays all the heap allocation in a process.

-   [**Analyze UMDH Logs**](analyze-umdh-logs.md) - Compares the allocation list made at two different times for the same process. Analyzing the differences can help to identify memory leaks.

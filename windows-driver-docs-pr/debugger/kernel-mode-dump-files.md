# Kernel-Mode Dump Files


## <span id="ddk_kernel_mode_dump_files_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_KERNEL_MODE_DUMP_FILES_DBG"></span>


When a kernel-mode error occurs, the default behavior of Microsoft Windows is to display the blue screen with bug check data.

However, there are several alternative behaviors that can be selected:

-   A kernel debugger (such as WinDbg or KD) can be contacted.

-   A memory dump file can be written.

-   The system can automatically reboot.

-   A memory dump file can be written, and the system can automatically reboot afterwards.

This section covers how to create and analyze a kernel-mode memory dump file. There are three different varieties of crash dump files. However, it should be remembered that no dump file can ever be as useful and versatile as a live kernel debugger attached to the system that has failed.

This section includes:

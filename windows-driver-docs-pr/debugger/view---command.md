Click **Command** on the **View** menu to open the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md). If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing ALT+1 or clicking the **Command (Alt+1)** button (![screen shot of the debugger command window button](images/tbcmd.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Debugger Command Window](debugger-command-window.md).

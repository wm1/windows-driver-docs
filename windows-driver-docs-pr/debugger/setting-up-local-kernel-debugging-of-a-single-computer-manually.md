# Setting Up Local Kernel Debugging of a Single Computer Manually


Debugging Tools for Windows supports *local kernel debugging*. This is kernel-mode debugging on a single computer. In other words, the debugger runs on the same computer that is being debugged. With local debugging you can examine state, but not break into kernel mode processes that would cause the OS to stop running.

The *local* bcdedit option is available in Windows 8.0 and Windows Server 2012 and later.

3.  Reboot the computer.

# Bug Check 0x12E: INVALID\_MDL\_RANGE


The INVALID\_MDL\_RANGE bug check has a value of 0x0000012E. This indicates that a driver has called the IoBuildPartialMdl() function and passed it an MDL to map part of a source MDL, but the virtual address range specified is outside the range in the source MDL. This is typically a driver bug.

The source and target MDLs, as well as the address range length to be mapped are the arguments to the IoBuildPartialMdl() function, i.e.;) .

```
IoBuildPartialMdl(
        IN PMDL SourceMdl,
        IN OUT PMDL TargetMdl,
        IN PVOID VirtualAddress,
        IN ULONG Length
```

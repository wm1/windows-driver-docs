# Changing Text Properties


## <span id="ddk_changing_text_properties_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CHANGING_TEXT_PROPERTIES_DBG"></span>


You can customize the font that is used in all of the debugging information windows. You can also change the tab width that is used in the [Source windows](source-window.md).

### <span id="setting_the_font__font_style__and_font_size"></span><span id="SETTING_THE_FONT__FONT_STYLE__AND_FONT_SIZE"></span>Setting the Font, Font Style, and Font Size

All debugging information windows share the same font. To change this font, click **Font** on the **View** menu, or click the **Font** button (![screen shot of the font button](images/tbfont.png)) on the toolbar.

In the **Font** dialog box, select the font, style, and size from the appropriate lists, and then click **OK**. All of the available fonts are fixed-pitch, because these kinds of fonts are the most useful for viewing code.

### <span id="setting_the_tab_width"></span><span id="SETTING_THE_TAB_WIDTH"></span>Setting the Tab Width

To change the tab width settings, click **Options** on the **View** menu or click the **Options** button (![screen shot of the options button](images/tbopt.png)) on the toolbar.

The **Options** dialog box then appears. In the **Tab width** box, enter the number of spaces that the tab width should be equivalent to, and then click **OK**.

The tab settings affect the display of the code in any Source window.

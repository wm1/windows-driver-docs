# WinDbg Preview - Starting a kernel mode session 

This topic describes how to start a kernel mode session with WinDbg Preview.

The process is very similar to how it has been done with previous versions of WinDbg. Select the tab for the type of transport you're using, fill in the required fields, and click OK.

> [!NOTE]
> Local kernel debugging requires WinDbg Preview to be launched elevated.

The *Paste* tab allows you to paste in custom connection strings.

If you are not familiar with setting up a debugger kernel mode session, see [Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)](getting-started-with-windbg--kernel-mode-.md)

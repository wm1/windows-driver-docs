# Bug Check 0x5: INVALID\_PROCESS\_ATTACH\_ATTEMPT


The INVALID\_PROCESS\_ATTACH\_ATTEMPT bug check has a value of 0x00000005. This generally indicates that the thread was attached to a process in a situation where that is not allowed. For example, this bug check could occur if **KeAttachProcess** was called when the thread was already attached to a process (which is illegal), or if the thread returned from certain function calls in an attached state (which is invalid),

This bug check appears very infrequently.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

Remarks
-------

This bug check can occur if the driver calls the **KeAttachProcess** function and the thread is already attached to another process. It is better to use the **KeStackAttachProcess** function. If the current thread was already attached to another process, the **KeStackAttachProcess** function saves the current APC state before it attaches the current thread to the new process.

To see a list of all processes and threads, use the [**!process**](-process.md) extension.

For general information about processes and threads in kernel mode, see [Changing Contexts](changing-contexts.md). For more information about analyzing processes and threads, see *Microsoft Windows Internals*, by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. (This book may not be available in some languages and countries.)

Remarks
-------

Zombie processes are dead processes that have not yet been removed from the process list. Zombie threads are analogous.

This extension is available only for Windows 2000.

You can use Microsoft Visual Studio to set up and perform kernel-mode debugging of Windows. To use Visual Studio for kernel-mode debugging, you must have the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) integrated with Visual Studio. For information about how to install the integrated environment, see [Windows Driver Development](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?linkid=301383).

**Important**  This feature is not available in Windows 10, version 1507 and later versions of the WDK.

 

As an alternative to using Visual Studio to set up kernel-mode debugging, you can do the setup manually. For more information, see [Setting Up Kernel-Mode Debugging Manually](setting-up-kernel-mode-debugging-in-windbg--cdb--or-ntsd.md).

Kernel-mode debugging typically requires two computers. The debugger runs on the *host computer,* and the code being debugged runs on the *target computer*.

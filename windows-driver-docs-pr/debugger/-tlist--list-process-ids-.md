<span id="_______Options______"></span><span id="_______options______"></span><span id="_______OPTIONS______"></span> *Options*   
Can be any number of the following options:

<span id="-v"></span><span id="-V"></span>**-v**  
Causes the display to be verbose. This includes the session number, the process user name, and the command-line used to start the process.

<span id="-c"></span><span id="-C"></span>**-c**  
Limits the display to just the current process.

<span id="_______FileNamePattern______"></span><span id="_______filenamepattern______"></span><span id="_______FILENAMEPATTERN______"></span> *FileNamePattern*   
Specifies the file name to be displayed, or a pattern that the file name of the process must match. Only those processes whose file names match this pattern will be displayed. *FileNamePattern* may contain a variety of wildcards and specifiers; see [String Wildcard Syntax](string-wildcard-syntax.md) for details. This match is made only against the actual file name, not the path.

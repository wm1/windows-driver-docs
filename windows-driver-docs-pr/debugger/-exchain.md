<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Windows 2000</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Ext.dll</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Windows XP and later</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Ext.dll</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The **!exchain** extension is available only for an x86-based target computer.

Remarks
-------

The **!exchain** extension displays the list of exception handlers for the current thread.

The list begins with the first handler on the chain (the one that is given the first opportunity to handle an exception) and continues on to the end. The following example shows this extension.

```
0:000> !exchain
0012fea8: Prymes!_except_handler3+0 (00407604)
  CRT scope  0, filter: Prymes!dzExcepError+e6 (00401576)
                func:   Prymes!dzExcepError+ec (0040157c)
0012ffb0: Prymes!_except_handler3+0 (00407604)
  CRT scope  0, filter: Prymes!mainCRTStartup+f8 (004021b8)
                func:   Prymes!mainCRTStartup+113 (004021d3)
0012ffe0: KERNEL32!GetThreadContext+1c (77ea1856)

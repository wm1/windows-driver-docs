For an overview of related commands and an explanation of how the reboot process affects the debugger, see [Crashing and Rebooting the Target Computer](crashing-and-rebooting-the-target-computer.md).

Remarks
-------

This control key causes the kernel debugger to cycle through the following three states:

<span id="No_break"></span><span id="no_break"></span><span id="NO_BREAK"></span>**No break**  
In this state, the debugger will not break into the target computer unless you press [**CTRL+C**](ctrl-c--break-.md).

<span id="Break_on_reboot"></span><span id="break_on_reboot"></span><span id="BREAK_ON_REBOOT"></span>**Break on reboot**  
In this state, the debugger will break into a rebooted target computer after the kernel initializes. This is equivalent to starting KD or WinDbg with the **-b**[command-line option](command-line-options.md).

<span id="Break_on_first_module_load"></span><span id="break_on_first_module_load"></span><span id="BREAK_ON_FIRST_MODULE_LOAD"></span>**Break on first module load**  
In this state, the debugger will break into a rebooted target computer after the first kernel module is loaded. (This will cause the break to occur earlier than in the **Break on reboot** option.) This is equivalent to starting KD or WinDbg with the **-d**[command-line option](command-line-options.md).

When CTRL+K is used, the new break state is displayed.

In WinDbg, this can also be accomplished by selecting [Debug | Kernel Connection | Cycle Initial Break](debug---kernel-connection---cycle-initial-break.md).

Remarks
-------

The **sqe** command turns quiet mode on, and the **sqd** command turns it off. The **sq** command turns on and off quiet mode. Each of these commands also displays the new quiet mode status.

You can set quiet mode in KD or kernel-mode WinDbg by using the KDQUIET [environment variable](kernel-mode-environment-variables.md). (Note that quiet mode exists in both user-mode and kernel-mode debugging, but the KDQUIET environment variable is only recognized in kernel mode.)

*Quiet mode* has three distinct effects:

-   The debugger does not display messages every time that an extension DLL is loaded or unloaded.

-   The [**r (Registers)**](r--registers-.md) command no longer requires an equal sign (=) in its syntax.

-   When you break into a target computer while kernel debugging, the long warning message is suppressed.

Do not confuse quiet mode with the effects of the **-myob** [command-line option](command-line-options.md) (in CDB and KD) or the **-Q** [**command-line option**](windbg-command-line-options.md) (in WinDbg).

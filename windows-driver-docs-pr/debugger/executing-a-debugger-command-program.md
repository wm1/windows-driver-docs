# Executing a Debugger Command Program


## <span id="ddk_debugger_command_program_execution_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_PROGRAM_EXECUTION_DBG"></span>


You can execute a debugger command program in one of the following ways:

-   Enter all of the statements in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md) as a single string, with individual statements and commands separated by semicolons.

-   Add all of the statements in a script file on a single line, with individual statements and commands separated by semicolons. Then, run this script file by using one of the methods described in [Using Script Files](using-script-files.md).

-   Add all of the statements in a script file, with each statement on a separate line. (Alternatively, separate statements by any combination of carriage returns and semicolons.) Then, run this script file by using the [**$&gt;&lt; (Run Script File)**](-----------------------a---run-script-file-.md) or **$$&gt;&lt; (Run Script File)** command. These commands open the specified script file, replace all carriage returns with semicolons, and execute the resulting text as a single command block.

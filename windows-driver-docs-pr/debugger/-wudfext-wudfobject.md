# !wudfext.wudfobject


The **!wudfext.wudfobject** extension displays information about a WDF object, as well as its parent and child relationships.

```
!wudfext.wudfobject pWDFObject Flags TypeName
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______pWDFObject______"></span><span id="_______pwdfobject______"></span><span id="_______PWDFOBJECT______"></span> *pWDFObject*   
Specifies the address of the WDF interface to display information about.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Optional. Specifies the type of information to be displayed. *Flags* can be any combination of the following bits. The default value is 0x01.

<span id="Bit_0__0x01_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x01_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X01_"></span>Bit 0 (0x01)  
Steps recursively through the object hierarchy to obtain the parent and child relationships, which are displayed.

<span id="Bit_1__0x02_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x02_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X02_"></span>Bit 1 (0x02)  
Displays only summary information about the object.

<span id="Bit_8__0x80_"></span><span id="bit_8__0x80_"></span><span id="BIT_8__0X80_"></span>Bit 8 (0x80)  
Steps recursively through the object hierarchy, and displays details about the internal framework.

<span id="_______TypeName______"></span><span id="_______typename______"></span><span id="_______TYPENAME______"></span> *TypeName*   
Optional. Specifies the type of the interface (for example, **IWDFDevice**). If a value for *TypeName* is supplied, the extension uses the value as the type of the interface. If an asterisk (\*) is supplied as *TypeName*, or if *TypeName* is omitted, the extension attempts to automatically determine the type of the supplied interface.

Remarks
-------

You can use **!wudfext.wudfobject** to list, for example, the child objects of an **IWDFDevice** object, which generally include the device's queues.

You can also use **!wudfext.wudfobject** to find WDF objects that are associated with a particular device, to check the state of a WDF object (for example, whether the WDF object is in the process of deletion), or to determine the WDF object's current reference count.

The **!wudfext.wudfobject** extension also displays the callback functions and context objects that the driver associated with each framework object and attempts to determine the framework object's type. This last feature might not work with certain compilers.

The following are some examples. In the first example, [**!wudfext.umdevstacks**](-wudfext-umdevstack.md) gives 0x03050E70 as the address of a device object, and this address is then passed to **!wudfext.wudfobject**. The 0x1 flag is included to display all the children of this object.

Cause
-----

This bug check usually occurs because the component that owns the modified non-writeable pages failed to write out these pages after marking the relevant files as "do not write" to memory management. This indicates a driver bug.

Resolution
----------

For more information about which driver is causing the problem, use the [**!vm 3**](-vm.md) extension, followed by [**!memusage 1**](-memusage.md) .

```

For information about debugger command programs and control flow tokens, see [Using Debugger Command Programs](using-debugger-command-programs.md).

Remarks
-------

When each block is entered, all aliases within the block are evaluated. If you alter the value of an alias at some point within a command block, commands subsequent to that point will not use the new alias value unless they are within a subordinate block.

Each block must begin with a control flow token. If you wish to create a block for the sole purpose of evaluating aliases, you should prefix it with the [**.block**](-block.md) token.

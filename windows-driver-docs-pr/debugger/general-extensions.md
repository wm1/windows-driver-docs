# General Extensions


## <span id="ddk_general_extensions_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_GENERAL_EXTENSIONS_DBG"></span>


This section describes extension commands that are frequently used during both user-mode and kernel-mode debugging.

The debugger automatically loads the proper version of these extension commands. Unless you have manually loaded a different version, you do not have to keep track of the DLL versions that are being used. For more information about the default module search order, see [Using Debugger Extension Commands](using-debugger-extension-commands.md). For more information about how to load extension modules, see [Loading Debugger Extension DLLs](loading-debugger-extension-dlls.md).

Each extension command reference topics lists the DLLs that expose that command. Use the following rules to determine the proper directory to load this extension DLL from:

-   If your target computer is running Microsoft Windows XP or a later version of Windows, use winxp\\kdexts.dll, winxp\\ntsdexts.dll, winxp\\exts.dll, winext\\ext.dll, or dbghelp.dll.

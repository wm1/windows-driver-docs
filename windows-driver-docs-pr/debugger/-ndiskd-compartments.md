# !ndiskd.compartments


The **!ndiskd.compartments** extension displays all network compartments.

```
!ndiskd.compartments 
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


This extension has no parameters.

### <span id="DLL"></span><span id="dll"></span>DLL

Ndiskd.dll

Remarks
-------

Compartments are a way that NDIS manages interfaces. Third party interface providers only use the primary compartment, as described in the **CompartmentId** member of the [**NDIS\_BIND\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564832) structure.

Examples
--------

Run the **!ndiskd.compartments** extension to see a list of all network compartments. In this example, there is only one compartment (the primary one).

```

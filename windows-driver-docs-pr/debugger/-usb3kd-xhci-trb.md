Remarks
-------

The output the [**!xhci\_trb**](-usb3kd-device-info.md) command is based on the data structures maintained by the USB 3.0 host controller driver (UsbXhci.sys). For more information about the USB 3.0 host controller driver and other drivers in the USB stack, see [USB Driver Stack Architecture](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?LinkID=251983).

Examples
--------

In the following example, **0x844d7c00** is the virtual address of a TRB. The **1** is the count, which specifies how many consecutive TRBs to display.

```
0: kd> !xhci_trb 0x844d7c00 1

        [  0] ISOCH        0x844d7c00 CycleBit 1 IOC 0 CH 1 BEI 0 InterrupterTarget 1 TransferLength  2688 TDSize  0 TBC 0 TLBPC 2 Frame 0x3D2
```

In the following example, **0x0dced7c00** is the physical address of a TRB. The **4** is the count, which specifies how many consecutive TRBs to display. The **1** specifies that the address is a physical address.

```
0: kd> !xhci_trb 0x0dced7c00 4 1

        [  0] ISOCH        0xdced7c00 CycleBit 1 IOC 0 CH 1 BEI 0 InterrupterTarget 1 TransferLength  2688 TDSize  0 TBC 0 TLBPC 2 Frame 0x3D2

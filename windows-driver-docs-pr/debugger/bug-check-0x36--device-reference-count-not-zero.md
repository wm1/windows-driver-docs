Cause
-----

A device driver has attempted to delete one of its device objects from the system, but the reference count for that object was non-zero.

This means there are still outstanding references to the device. (The reference count indicates the number of reasons why this device object cannot be deleted.)

This is a bug in the calling device driver.

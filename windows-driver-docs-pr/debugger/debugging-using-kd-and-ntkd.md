# Debugging Using KD and NTKD


This section describes how to perform basic debugging tasks using the KD and NTKD debuggers.

KD and NTKD are identical in every way, except that NTKD spawns a new text window when it is started, whereas KD inherits the Command Prompt window from which it was invoked. The instructions in this section are given for KD, but they work equally well for NTKD. For a discussion of when to use KD or NTKD, see [Debugging Environments](debuggers-in-the-debugging-tools-for-windows-package.md).

Details are given in the following topics:

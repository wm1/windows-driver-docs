# Creating a New Dock


## <span id="ddk_creating_new_docks_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CREATING_NEW_DOCKS_DBG"></span>


When WinDbg is started, the WinDbg window is the only possible docking location.

To create a new dock, on the **Window** menu, click **Open Dock**. This dock is an independent window that you can maximize, minimize, or drag like any other window on the desktop.

A new dock can also be created by using the **Move to new dock** option on the shortcut menu for any already open window. This selection will close the window and open it in a new dock.

You can create as many docks as you want.

To close a dock and any debugging information windows that are currently docked there, click the **Close** button in the upper-right corner of the dock.

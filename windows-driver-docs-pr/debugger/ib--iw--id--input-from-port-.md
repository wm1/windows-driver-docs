Remarks
-------

The **ib** command reads a single byte, the **iw** command reads a word, and the **id** command reads a double word.

Make sure that reading an I/O port does not affect the behavior of the device that you are reading from. Some devices change state after a read-only port has been read. You should also not try to read a word or double-word from a port that does not allow values of this length.

# WdbgExts Symbols


This topic provides a brief overview of how symbols can be manipulated using the WdbgExts API. For an overview of using symbols in the [debugger engine](introduction.md#debugger-engine), see [Symbols](symbols.md) in the [Debugger Engine Overview](debugger-engine-overview.md) section of this documentation.

To evaluate a MASM or C++ expression, use the functions [**GetExpression**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546683) or [**GetExpressionEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546691).

To read the value of a member in a structure, use the [**GetFieldData**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546743) function or, if, the member contains a primitive value, [**GetFieldValue**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546781) can be used. To determine the size of an instance of a symbol in the target's memory, use the [**GetTypeSize**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549446) function.

To locate the offset of a member in a structure, use the [**GetFieldOffset**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546758) function.

To read multiple members in a structure, first use the [**InitTypeRead**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550953) function to initialize the structure. Then, you can use the [**ReadField**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553539) function to read the members with size less than or equal to 8 bytes one at a time. For structure addresses in physical memory, use the [**InitTypeReadPhysical**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550957) function instead of **InitTypeRead**.

There are two functions that you can use for iterating over linked lists. For doubly-linked lists that use the LIST\_ENTRY32 or LIST\_ENTRY64 structures, the function [**ReadListEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553585) can be used to find the next and previous entries. The function [**ListType**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551988) will iterate over all the entries in a linked list and call a callback function for each entry.

To locate a symbol near a specified address in the target's memory, use the [**GetSymbol**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548447) function.

To delete all the symbol information from the debugger engine's cache, use the [**ReloadSymbols**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554381) function. To read or change the symbol path, which is used to search for symbol files, use the [**GetSetSympath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548291) function.

Almost all symbol operations provided by the debugger engine can be executed using the [**Ioctl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551084) operation [**IG\_DUMP\_SYMBOL\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550906). However, while being a very flexible function, it is advanced and we recommend that you use the above simpler functions where applicable.

# Opening a Dump File Using CDB

In a Command Prompt window, you can open a user-mode dump file when you launch CDB. Enter the following command.

**cdb -y** *SymbolPath* **-i** *ImagePath* **-z** *DumpFileName*

The **-v** option (verbose mode) is also useful. For more information about the command-line syntax, see [**CDB Command-Line Options**](cdb-command-line-options.md)

You can also open a dump file after the debugger is running by entering the [**.opendump (Open Dump File)**](-opendump--open-dump-file-.md) command, followed by [**g (Go)**](g--go-.md). This allows you to debug multiple dump files at the same time.

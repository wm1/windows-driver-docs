For details on loading, unloading, and controlling extensions, see [Loading Debugger Extension DLLs](loading-debugger-extension-dlls.md). For details on executing extension commands, see [Using Debugger Extension Commands](using-debugger-extension-commands.md).

Remarks
-------

The debugger maintains a default extension DLL that is implicitly loaded when the debugger is started. This allows the user to specify an extension command without first having to load an extension DLL. This command allows modification of which DLL is loaded as the default DLL.

When a command is issued, the debugger looks for it in the default extension first. If a match is not found, all other loaded extension DLLs are searched in the order they were loaded.

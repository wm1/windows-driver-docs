# Varieties of User-Mode Dump Files


## <span id="ddk_varieties_of_user_mode_dump_files_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_VARIETIES_OF_USER_MODE_DUMP_FILES_DBG"></span>


There are several kinds of user-mode crash dump files, but they are divided into two categories:

[Full User-Mode Dumps](full-user-mode-dumps.md)

[Minidumps](minidumps.md)

The difference between these dump files is one of size. Minidumps are usually more compact, and can be easily sent to an analyst.

**Note**   Much information can be obtained by analyzing a dump file. However, no dump file can provide as much information as actually debugging the crash directly with a debugger.

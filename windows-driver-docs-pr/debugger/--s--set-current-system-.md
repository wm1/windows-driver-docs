# ||s (Set Current System)


The **||s** command sets or displays the current system number.

```
||System s 
|| s 
```

Do not confuse this command with the [**s (Search Memory)**](s--search-memory-.md), [**~s (Change Current Processor)**](-s--change-current-processor-.md), [**~s (Set Current Thread)**](-s--set-current-thread-.md), or [**|s (Set Current Process)**](-s--set-current-process-.md) command.

Remarks
-------

The **||s** command is useful when you are debugging multiple targets or working with multiple dump files.  For more information about these kinds of sessions, see [Debugging Multiple Targets](debugging-multiple-targets.md).

If you use the **||s** syntax, the debugger displays information about the current system.

This command also disassembles the current instruction for the current system, process, and thread.

 
**Note**   There are complications, when you debug live targets and dump targets together, because commands behave differently for each type of debugging. For example, if you use the **g (Go)** command when the current system is a dump file, the debugger begins executing, but you cannot break back into the debugger, because the break command is not recognized as valid for dump file debugging.

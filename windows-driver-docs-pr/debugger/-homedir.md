Remarks
-------

If the **!homedir** extension is used with no argument, the current home directory is displayed.

The cache for a source server is located in the src subdirectory of the home directory. The downstream store for a symbol server defaults to the sym subdirectory of the home directory, unless a different location is specified.

When WinDbg is started, the home directory is the directory where Debugging Tools for Windows was installed. The **!homedir** extension can be used to change this value.

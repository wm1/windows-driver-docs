For more general information about threads, see [Threads and Processes](controlling-threads-and-processes.md). For more information about manipulating or obtaining information about threads, see [Controlling Processes and Threads](controlling-processes-and-threads.md).

Remarks
-------

If no arguments are supplied, the debugger displays a list of all threads, along with thread wait states. This is equivalent to entering [**!thread @\#Thread 2**](-process.md) as the *CommandString* value.

You can terminate execution at any point by pressing CTRL+BREAK (in WinDbg) or CTRL+C (in KD).

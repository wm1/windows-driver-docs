Remarks
-------

You can use this command in a kernel-mode debugging session or in a user-mode debugging session that is attached to the UMDF host process (wudfhost.exe).

To use this command, follow these steps:

1.  Enter this command, passing only the address a user-mode IRP. The command displays a handle.
2.  Pass the displayed handle to the [**!handle**](-handle.md) command. In the output of **!handle**, find the address of a **\_FILE\_OBJECT** structure.
3.  Enter this command again, passing both the address of the user-mode IRP and the address of the **\_FILE\_OBJECT** structure.

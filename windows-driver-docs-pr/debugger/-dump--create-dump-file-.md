# .dump (Create Dump File)


The **.dump** command creates a user-mode or kernel-mode crash dump file.

```
.dump Options FileName 
.dump /?
```

<span id="_______Options______"></span><span id="_______options______"></span><span id="_______OPTIONS______"></span> *Options*   
Represents one or more of the following options

<span id="_o"></span><span id="_O"></span>**/o**  
Overwrites an existing dump file with the same name. If this option is not used and there is a file with the same file name, the dump file is not written.

<span id="_f_FullOptions_"></span><span id="_f_fulloptions_"></span><span id="_F_FULLOPTIONS_"></span>**/f\[***FullOptions***\]**  
(Kernel mode:) Creates a [complete memory dump](complete-memory-dump.md).

(User mode:) Creates a [full user-mode dump](full-user-mode-dumps.md). Despite their names, the largest minidump file actually contains more information than a full user-mode dump. For example, **.dump /mf** or **.dump /ma** creates a larger and more complete file than **.dump /f**. In user mode, **.dump** **/m\[***MiniOptions***\]** is always preferable to **.dump /f**.

You can add the following *FullOptions* to change the contents of the dump file; the option is case-sensitive.

<span id="_m_MiniOptions_"></span><span id="_m_minioptions_"></span><span id="_M_MINIOPTIONS_"></span>**/m\[***MiniOptions***\]**  
Creates a [small memory dump](cdb-and-windbg.md) (in kernel mode) or a [minidump](minidumps.md) (in user mode). If neither **/f** nor **/m** is specified, **/m** is the default.

In user mode, **/m** can be followed with additional *MiniOptions* specifying extra data that is to be included in the dump. If no *MiniOptions* are included, the dump will include module, thread, and stack information, but no additional data. You can add any of the following *MiniOptions* to change the contents of the dump file; they are case-sensitive.

These *MiniOptions* can only be used when creating a user-mode minidump. They should follow the **/m** specifier.

<span id="_u"></span><span id="_U"></span>**/u**  
Appends the date, time, and PID to the dump file names. This ensures that dump file names are unique.

<span id="_a"></span><span id="_A"></span>**/a**  
Generates dumps for all currently-debugged processes. If **/a** is used, the **/u** option should also be used to ensure that each file has a unique name.

<span id="_ba"></span><span id="_BA"></span>**/b**\[**a**\]  
Creates a .cab file. If this option is included, *FileName* is interpreted as the CAB file name, not the dump file name. A temporary dump file will be created, this file will be packaged into a CAB, and then the dump file will be deleted. If the **b** option is followed by **a**, all symbol and image files also will be packaged into the CAB.

<span id="_c__Comment_"></span><span id="_c__comment_"></span><span id="_C__COMMENT_"></span>**/c "***Comment***"**  
Specifies a comment string that will be written to the dump file. If *Comment* contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes. When the dump file is loaded, the *Comment* string will be displayed.

<span id="_xc_Address"></span><span id="_xc_address"></span><span id="_XC_ADDRESS"></span>**/xc** *Address*  
(User mode minidumps only) Adds a context record to the dump file. *Address* must specify the address of the context record.

<span id="_xr_Address"></span><span id="_xr_address"></span><span id="_XR_ADDRESS"></span>**/xr** *Address*  
(User mode minidumps only) Adds an exception record to the dump file. *Address* must specify the address of the exception record.

<span id="_xp_Address"></span><span id="_xp_address"></span><span id="_XP_ADDRESS"></span>**/xp** *Address*  
(User mode minidumps only) Adds a context record and an exception record to the dump file. *Address* must specify the address of an EXCEPTION\_POINTERS structure which contains pointers to the context record and the exception record.

<span id="_xt_ThreadID"></span><span id="_xt_threadid"></span><span id="_XT_THREADID"></span>**/xt** *ThreadID*  
(User mode minidumps only) Specifies the thread ID of the system thread that will be used as the exception thread for this dump file.

<span id="_kpmf_File"></span><span id="_kpmf_file"></span><span id="_KPMF_FILE"></span>**/kpmf** *File*  
(Only when creating a kernel-mode Complete Memory Dump) Specifies a file that contains physical memory page data.

<span id="_j_Address"></span><span id="_j_address"></span><span id="_J_ADDRESS"></span>**/j** *Address*  
Adds the JIT\_DEBUG\_INFO structure to the dump file in user mode. *Address* must specify the address of the JIT\_DEBUG\_INFO structure. This address is normally provided via the %p parameter when the .jdinfo command is used as part of a just in time postmortem debugging process. For more information, see [**.jdinfo (Use JIT\_DEBUG\_INFO)**](-jdinfo--use-jit-debug-info-.md) and [Enabling Postmortem Debugging](enabling-postmortem-debugging.md).

<span id="_______FileName______"></span><span id="_______filename______"></span><span id="_______FILENAME______"></span> *FileName*   
Specifies the name of the dump file. You can specify a full path and file name or just the file name. If the file name contains spaces, *FileName* should be enclosed in quotation marks. If no path is specified, the current directory is used.

<span id="_______-_______"></span> **-?**   
Displays help for this command. This text is different in kernel mode and in user mode.

For a description of kernel-mode dump files and an explanation of their use, see [Kernel-Mode Dump Files](kernel-mode-dump-files.md). For a description of user-mode dump files and an explanation of their use, see [User-Mode Dump Files](user-mode-dump-files.md).

Remarks
-------

This command can be used in a variety of situations:

-   During live user-mode debugging, this command directs the target application to generate a dump file, but the target application does not terminate.

-   During live kernel-mode debugging, this command directs the target computer to generate a dump file, but the target computer does not crash.

-   During crash dump debugging, this command creates a new crash dump file from the old one. This is useful if you have a large crash dump file and want to create a smaller one.

You can control what type of dump file will be produced:

-   In kernel mode, to produce a [complete memory dump](complete-memory-dump.md), use the **/f** option. To produce a [small memory dump](small-memory-dump.md), use the **/m** option (or no options). The .dump command cannot produce a [kernel memory dump](kernel-memory-dump.md).

-   In user mode, **.dump** **/m\[***MiniOptions***\]** is the best choice. Although "m" stands for "minidump", the dump files created by using this *MiniOption* can vary in size from very small to very large. By specifying the proper *MiniOptions* you can control exactly what information is included. For example, **.dump /ma** produces a dump with a great deal of information. The older command, **.dump /f**, produces a moderately large "standard dump" file and cannot be customized.

You cannot specify which process is dumped. All running processes will be dumped.

The **/xc**, **/xr**, **/xp**, and **/xt** options are used to store exception and context information in the dump file. This allows the [**.ecxr (Display Exception Context Record)**](-ecxr--display-exception-context-record-.md) command to be run on this dump file.

The following example will create a user-mode minidump, containing full memory and handle information:

```
0:000> .dump /mfh myfile.dmp 
```

Handle information can be read by using the [**!handle**](-handle.md) extension command.

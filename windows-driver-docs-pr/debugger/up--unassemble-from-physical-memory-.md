<span id="_______Range______"></span><span id="_______range______"></span><span id="_______RANGE______"></span> *Range*   
Specifies the memory range in physical memory that contains the instructions to disassemble. For more information about the syntax, see [Address and Address Range Syntax](address-and-address-range-syntax.md).

<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the beginning of the memory range in physical memory to disassemble. Eight instructions (on an x86-based processor) or nine instructions (on an Itanium-based processor) are unassembled. For more information about the syntax, see [Address and Address Range Syntax](address-and-address-range-syntax.md).

Remarks
-------

If you do not specify a parameter for the **up** command, the disassembly begins at the current address and extends eight instructions (on an x86-based processor) or nine instructions (on an Itanium-based processor).

Do not confuse this command with the [**u (Unassemble)**](u--unassemble-.md). The **up** command disassembles only physical memory, while the **u** command disassembles only virtual memory.

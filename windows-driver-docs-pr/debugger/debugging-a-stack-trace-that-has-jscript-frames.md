# Debugging a Stack Trace that has JScript Frames


The JScript Stack Dump Creation and Consumption feature works by collecting JScript frames and stitching them against debugger physical frames. Sometimes on x86 platforms, the debugger constructs the stack trace incorrectly.

If your stack includes JScript frames that you think might be incorrect, enter the following command in the debugger.

**.stkwalk\_force\_frame\_pointer 1**

For information about debugging information windows, see [Using Debugging Information Windows](using-debugging-information-windows.md).

Remarks
-------

Without any parameters, **.suspend\_ui** displays whether debugging information windows are currently suspended.

By default, debugging information windows are refreshed every time the information they display changes.

Suspending the refresh of these windows can speed up WinDbg during a sequence of quick operations -- for example, when tracing or stepping many times in quick succession.

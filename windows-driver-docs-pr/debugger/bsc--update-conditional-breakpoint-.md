# bsc (Update Conditional Breakpoint)


The **bsc** command changes the condition under which a breakpoint occurs or changes the command executed when the specified conditional breakpoint is encountered.

```
bsc ID Condition ["CommandString"] 
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______ID______"></span><span id="_______id______"></span> *ID*   
Specifies the ID number of the breakpoint.

<span id="_______Condition______"></span><span id="_______condition______"></span><span id="_______CONDITION______"></span> *Condition*   
Specifies the condition under which the breakpoint should be triggered.

<span id="_______CommandString______"></span><span id="_______commandstring______"></span><span id="_______COMMANDSTRING______"></span> *CommandString*   
Specifies the new list of commands to be executed every time that the breakpoint is encountered. You must enclose the *CommandString* parameter in quotation marks. Use semicolons to separate multiple commands.

Debugger commands in *CommandString* can include parameters. You can use standard C-control characters (such as **\\n** and **\\"**). Semicolons that are contained in second-level quotation marks (**\\"**) are interpreted as part of the embedded quoted string.

The CommandString commands are executed only if the breakpoint is reached while the application is executing in response to a **g (Go)** command. The commands are not executed if you are stepping through the code or tracing past this point.

Any command that resumes program execution after a breakpoint (such as **g** or **t**) ends the execution of the command list.

For more information about and examples of how to use breakpoints, other breakpoint commands and methods of controlling breakpoints, and how to set breakpoints in user space from a kernel debugger, see [Using Breakpoints](using-breakpoints.md). For more information about conditional breakpoints, see [Setting a Conditional Breakpoint](setting-a-conditional-breakpoint.md).

Remarks
-------

If the *CommandString* is not specified, any commands already set on the breakpoint are removed.

The same effect can be achieved by using the [**bs (Update Breakpoint Command)**](bs--update-breakpoint-command-.md) command with the following syntax:

```
bs ID "j Condition 'CommandString'; 'gc'"
```

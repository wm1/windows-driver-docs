# gc (Go from Conditional Breakpoint)


The **gc** command resumes execution from a conditional breakpoint in the same fashion that was used to hit the breakpoint (stepping, tracing, or freely executing).

```
gc

Remarks
-------

When a [conditional breakpoint](setting-a-conditional-breakpoint.md) includes an execution command at the end, this should be the **gc** command.

For example, the following is a proper conditional breakpoint formulation:

```
0:000> bp Address "j (Condition) 'OptionalCommands'; 'gc' " 
```

When this breakpoint is encountered and the expression is false, execution will resume using the same execution type that was previously used. For example, if you used a **g (Go)** command to reach this breakpoint, execution would resume freely. But if you reached this breakpoint while stepping or tracing, execution would resume with a step or a trace.

On the other hand, the following is an improper breakpoint formulation, since execution will always resume freely even if you had been stepping before reaching the breakpoint:

```
0:000> bp Address "j (Condition) 'OptionalCommands'; 'g' " 
```

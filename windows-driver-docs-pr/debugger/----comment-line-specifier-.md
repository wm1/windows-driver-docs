# \* (Comment Line Specifier)


If the asterisk ( **\*** ) character is at the start of a command, then the rest of the line is treated as a comment, even if a semicolon appears after it.

```
* [any text]
```

Remarks
-------

The **\*** token is parsed like any other debugger command. Therefore, if you want to create a comment after another command, you must precede the **\*** token with a semicolon.

The **\*** token will cause the remainder of the line to be ignored, even if a semicolon appears after it. This differs from [**$$ (Comment Specifier)**](-----comment-specifier-.md), which creates a comment that can be terminated by a semicolon.

For example, the following command will display **eax** and **ebx**, but not **ecx**:

```
0:000> r eax; $$ some text; r ebx; * more text; r ecx 
```

Text prefixed by the **\*** or [**$$**](-----comment-specifier-.md) tokens is not processed in any way. If you are performing remote debugging, a comment entered in the debugging server will not be visible in the debugging client, nor vice-versa. If you wish to make comment text appear in the Debugger Command window in a way visible to all parties, you should use [**.echo (Echo Comment)**](-echo--echo-comment-.md).

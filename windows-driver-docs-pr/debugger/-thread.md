# !thread


The **!thread** extension displays summary information about a thread on the target system, including the ETHREAD block. This command can be used only during kernel-mode debugging.

This extension command is not the same as the [**.thread (Set Register Context)**](-thread--set-register-context-.md) command.

Syntax

```
!thread [-p] [-t] [Address [Flags]]
```

## <span id="ddk__thread_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__THREAD_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______-p______"></span><span id="_______-P______"></span> **-p**   
Displays summary information about the process that owns the thread.

<span id="_______-t______"></span><span id="_______-T______"></span> **-t**   
When this option is included, *Address* is the thread ID, not the thread address.

<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the hexadecimal address of the thread on the target computer. If *Address* is -1 or omitted, it indicates the current thread.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Specifies the level of detail to display. *Flags* can be any combination of the following bits. If *Flags* is 0, only a minimal amount of information is displayed. The default is 0x6:

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
Displays the thread's wait states.

<span id="Bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="BIT_2__0X4_"></span>Bit 2 (0x4)  
If this bit is used without Bit 1 (0x2), it has no effect. If this bit is used with Bit 1, the thread is displayed with a stack trace.

<span id="Bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="BIT_3__0X8_"></span>Bit 3 (0x8)  
Adds the return address, the stack pointer, and (on Itanium systems) the **bsp** register value to the information displayed for each function and suppresses the display of function arguments.

<span id="Bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="BIT_4__0X10_"></span>Bit 4 (0x10)  
Sets the process context equal to the process that owns the specified thread for the duration of this command. This results in more accurate display of thread stacks.

Use commands like [**!process**](-process.md) to locate the address or thread ID of the thread you are interested in.

The useful information in the **!thread** display is explained in the following table.

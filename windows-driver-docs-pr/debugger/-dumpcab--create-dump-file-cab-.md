Remarks
-------

This command can only be used if you are already debugging a dump file.

If you are debugging a live target and want to create a dump file and place it in a CAB, you should use the [**.dump (Create Dump File)**](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) command. Next, start a new debugging session with the dump file as its target, and use **.dumpcab**.

The **.dumpcab** command cannot be used to place multiple dump files into one CAB file.

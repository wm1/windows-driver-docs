# Debugging Techniques


This section discusses two types of debugging techniques: standard and specialized. Standard techniques apply to most debugging scenarios, and examples include setting breakpoints, inspecting the call stack, and finding a memory leak. Specialized techniques apply to particular technologies or types of code, and examples are Plug and Play debugging, Kernel Mode Driver Framework debugging, and RPC debugging.

The display will include verifier settings for the driver, and will also include a count of WDF objects. This flag can be combined with bit 6 (0x40) to display internal objects.

<span id="Bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="BIT_4__0X10_"></span>Bit 4 (0x10)  
The display will include the KMDF handle hierarchy for the driver.

The display will include context and callback function information for each handle. This flag is valid only when bit 4 (0x10) is set.

<span id="Bit_6__0x40_"></span><span id="bit_6__0x40_"></span><span id="BIT_6__0X40_"></span>Bit 6 (0x40)  
The display will include additional information for each handle. This flag is valid only when bit 4 (0x10) is set. This flag can be combined with bit 0 (0x1) to display internal objects.

<span id="Bit_7__0x80_"></span><span id="bit_7__0x80_"></span><span id="BIT_7__0X80_"></span>Bit 7 (0x80)  
The handle information will be displayed in a more compact format.

The display will include handles that the driver potentially leaked. KMDF version 1.1 and later support this flag. This flag is valid only when bit 4 (0x10) is set.

<span id="Bit_10__0x400_"></span><span id="bit_10__0x400_"></span><span id="BIT_10__0X400_"></span>Bit 10 (0x400)

Remarks
-------

If you omit the *DriverName* parameter, the default driver is used. You can display the default driver by using the [**!wdfkd.wdfgetdriver**](-wdfkd-wdfgetdriver.md) extension; you can set the default driver by using the [**!wdfkd.wdfsetdriver**](-wdfkd-wdfsetdriver.md) extension.

The following example shows the display from the **!wdfkd.wdfdriverinfo** extension.

```

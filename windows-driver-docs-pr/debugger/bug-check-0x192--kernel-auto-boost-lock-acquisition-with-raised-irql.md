| Parameter | Description                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1         | The address of the thread               |
| 2         | The lock address                        |
| 3         | The IRQL at which the lock was acquired |
| 4         | Reserved                                |

 

Cause
-----

The caller cannot be blocking on a lock above APC\_LEVEL because the lock may be held exclusively by the interrupted thread, which would cause a deadlock.

Remarks
-------

With no parameters, **.allow\_image\_mapping** will display whether image file mapping is currently allowed. By default, this mapping is allowed.

Image mapping is most common when a minidump is being debugged. Image mapping can also occur if DbgHelp is unable to access debug records (for example, during kernel debugging when memory has been paged out).

Remarks
-------

After using this extension, you must resume program execution (for example, by using the [**g (Go)**](g--go-.md) command) in order for it to take effect. After a brief time, the target computer automatically breaks into the debugger again.

To start the ETW logger, use [**!wmitrace.start**](-wmitrace-start.md).

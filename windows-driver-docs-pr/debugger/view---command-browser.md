# View | Command Browser


Click **Command Browser** on the **View** menu to open the [Command Browser window](command-browser-window.md). If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+N or clicking the **Command Browser (Ctrl+N)** button (![screen shot of the command browser button](images/window-command-browser-icon.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Command Browser Window](command-browser-window.md).

For information about Driver Verifier, see the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation.

Remarks
-------

When verifying drivers that are not graphics drivers, the standard kernel-mode extension [**!verifier**](-verifier.md) should be used instead of **!gdikdx.verifier**.

Regardless of which flags are selected, this extension will display the Driver Verifier options that are active. It will also display statistics on the frequency of random failure.

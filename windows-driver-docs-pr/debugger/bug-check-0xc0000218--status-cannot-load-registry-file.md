This bug check displays a descriptive text message. The name of the damaged file is displayed as part of the message.

Cause
-----

This error occurs if a necessary registry hive file cannot be loaded. Usually this means the file is corrupt or is missing.

In rare instances, this error can be caused by a driver that has corrupted the registry image in memory, or by a memory error in this region.

Resolution
----------

Try using the the startup recovery mechanism (for example Startup Repair, Recovery Console, or Emergency Recovery Disk) provided by the operating system. If the problem is a missing or corrupt registry file, that usually fixes the problem.

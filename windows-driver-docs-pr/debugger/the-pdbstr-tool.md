# The PDBStr Tool


The PDBStr (Pdbstr.exe) tool is used by the indexing scripts to insert the version control information into the "srcsrv" alternative stream of the target .pdb file. It can also read any stream from a .pdb file. You can use this information to verify that the indexing scripts are working properly.

For more information, run PDBStr with the **-?** option.

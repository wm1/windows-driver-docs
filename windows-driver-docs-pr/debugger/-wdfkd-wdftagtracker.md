Remarks
-------

To retrieve a pointer to a tag tracker, use the [**!wdfkd.wdfobject**](-wdfkd-wdfobject.md) extension on an internal framework object pointer.

To use tag tracking, you must enable both the Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) verifier and handle tracking in the registry. Both of these settings are stored in the driver's **Parameters\\Wdf** subkey of the **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services** key.

To enable the KMDF verifier, set a nonzero value for **VerifierOn**.

To enable handle tracking, set the value of **TrackHandles** to the name of one or more object types, or specify an asterisk (\*) to track all object types. For example, the following example specifies the tracking of references to all WDFDEVICE and WDFQUEUE objects.

```
TrackHandles: MULTI_SZ: WDFDEVICE WDFQUEUE
```

When you enable handle tracking for an object type, the framework tracks the references that are taken on any object of that type. This setting is useful in finding driver memory leaks that unreleased references cause. **TrackHandles** works only if the KMDF verifier is enabled.

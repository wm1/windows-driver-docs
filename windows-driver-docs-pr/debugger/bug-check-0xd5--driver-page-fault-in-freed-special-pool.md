If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

Cause
-----

The Driver Verifier **Special Pool** option has caught the driver accessing memory which was earlier freed.

For information about the special pool, consult the Driver Verifier section of the Windows Driver Kit.

Remarks
-------

This cannot be protected by a **try - except** handler -- it can only be protected by a probe.

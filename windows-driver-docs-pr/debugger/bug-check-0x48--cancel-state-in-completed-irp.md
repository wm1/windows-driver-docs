Cause
-----

An IRP that had a *Cancel* routine set was completed normally, without cancellation. But after it was complete, a driver called the IRP's *Cancel* routine.

This could be caused by a driver that completed the IRP and then attempted to cancel it.

It could also be caused by two drivers each trying to access the same IRP in an improper way.

Resolution
----------

The cancel routine parameter can be used to determine which driver or stack caused the bug check.

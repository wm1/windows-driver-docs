Remarks
-------

The **.endpsrv** command terminates the process server or KD connection server currently connected to your smart client.

If you wish to terminate a process server or KD connection server from the computer on which it is running, use Task Manager to end the process (dbgsrv.exe or kdsrv.exe).

The **.endpsrv** command can terminate a process server or KD connection server, but it cannot terminate a debugging server. For information on how to do that, see [Controlling a Remote Debugging Session](controlling-a-remote-debugging-session.md).

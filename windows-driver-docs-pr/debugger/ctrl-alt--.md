Remarks
-------

This is equivalent to launching a new CDB through the [**remote.exe**](the-remote-exe-utility.md) utility, and using it to debug the debugger that you are already running.

**CTRL+ALT+\\** is similar to the [**.dbgdbg (Debug Current Debugger)**](-dbgdbg--debug-current-debugger-.md) command, however **CTRL+ALT+\\** has the advantage that it can be used when no debugger command line is available.

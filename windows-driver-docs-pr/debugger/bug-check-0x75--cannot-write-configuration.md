Cause
-----

The CANNOT\_WRITE\_CONFIGURATION bug check typically occurs if the system is out of pool and the Windows operating system cannot reopen the hive.

This bug check should almost never occur, because the conversion of the hive file occurs early enough during system initialization so that enough pool should be available.

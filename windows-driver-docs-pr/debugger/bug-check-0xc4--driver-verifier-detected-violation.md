# Bug Check 0xC4: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION


The DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION bug check has a value of 0x000000C4. This is the general bug check code for fatal errors found by Driver Verifier. For more information, see [Handling a Bug Check When Driver Verifier is Enabled](handling-a-bug-check-when-driver-verifier-is-enabled.md).

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

## DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION Parameters


Parameter 1 identifies the type of violation. The meaning of the remaining parameters varies with the value of Parameter 1. The parameter values are described in the following table.

Cause
-----

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause. Further information can be obtained by using the [**!analyze -v**](-analyze.md) extension.

Resolution
----------

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

For full details on Driver Verifier, see the [Driver Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545448) section of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

Remarks
-------

The \_POOL\_TYPE codes are enumerated in Ntddk.h. In particular, **0** (zero) indicates nonpaged pool and **1** (one) indicates paged pool.

*(Windows 8 and later versions of Windows)* If [DDI compliance checking](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh454208) causes a bug check, run [Static Driver Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552808) on the driver source code and specify the DDI compliance rule (identified by the parameter 1 value) that caused the bug check. Static Driver Verifier can help you locate the cause of the problem in your source code.

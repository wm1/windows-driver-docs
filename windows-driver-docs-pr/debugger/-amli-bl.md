Remarks
-------

The AMLI Debugger supports a maximum of ten breakpoints.

Here is an example of the **!amli bl** extension:

```
kd> !amli bl
 0: <e> ffffffff80e5e2f1:[\_SB.LNKD._SRS]
 1: <e> ffffffff80e5d969:[\_SB.LNKB._STA]
 2: <d> ffffffff80e630c9:[\_WAK]
 3: <e> ffffffff80e612c9:[\_SB.MBRD._CRS]
```

The first column gives the breakpoint number. The **&lt;e&gt;** and **&lt;d&gt;** marks indicate whether the breakpoint is enabled or disabled. The address of the breakpoint is in the next column. Finally, the method containing the breakpoint is listed, with the offset of the breakpoint if it is not set at the start of the method.

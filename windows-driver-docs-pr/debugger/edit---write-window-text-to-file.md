# Edit | Write Window Text to File


## <span id="ddk_edit_write_window_text_to_file_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_EDIT_WRITE_WINDOW_TEXT_TO_FILE_DBG"></span>


Click **Write Window Text to File** on the **Edit** menu to save all of the text in the active debugging information window to a file.

This command is available only if the active window is the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md), [Calls window](calls-window.md), or Scratch Pad.

### <span id="dialog_box"></span><span id="DIALOG_BOX"></span>Dialog Box

When you click **Write Windows Text to File**, the **Write Window Text to File** dialog box appears. In this dialog box, enter the name of the file where you want to save the window text. You can browse in the **Save in** list to the directory that you want or select a specific file that you want to overwrite. The default file name extension is .txt.

Click **Save** to save the file or click **Cancel** to exit.

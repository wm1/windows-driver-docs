Remarks
-------

If the Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) verifier is enabled for a driver and the public handle type was marked for tracking, the display from the **!wdfkd.wdfobject** extension includes the tag tracker (that is, the tracking object), as in the following example.

```
kd> !wdfobject 0x83584e38 

The type for object 0x83584e38 is FxDevice
State: FxObjectStateCreated (0x1)

!wdfhandle 0x7ca7b1c0

dt FxDevice 0x83584e38

    context:  dt 0x83584ff8 ROOT_CONTEXT (size is 0x1 bytes)
     <no associated attribute callbacks>

Object debug extension 83584e20
   !wdftagtracker 0x83722d80
   Verifier lock 0x831cefa8

   State history:

# Bug Check 0x7E: SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED


The SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000007E. This bug check indicates that a system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch.

Cause
-----

The SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED bug check is a common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.

Common exception codes include the following:

-   0x80000002: STATUS\_DATATYPE\_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.

-   0x80000003: STATUS\_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.

-   0xC0000005: STATUS\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.

For a complete list of exception codes, see the Ntstatus.h file that is located in the inc directory of the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

Resolution
----------

If you are not equipped to use the Windows debugger to work on this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.

-   Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.

-   If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.

-   Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.

-   You can also disable memory caching/shadowing of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, that the system manufacturer supplies.

-   Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at [Windows 10 Specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).

-   For additional general troubleshooting information, see [**Blue Screen Data**](blue-screen-data.md).

**If you plan to debug this problem,** Parameter 2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.

The [**!analyze**](-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be very helpful in determining the root cause.

If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the **/NODEBUG** switch. This problem should not occur frequently. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the **/DEBUG** switch.

If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.

If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. If the issue is narrowed down to a single driver, set breakpoints and single step in code to work to locate the failure and gain insight into events leading up to the crash.

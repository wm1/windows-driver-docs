For more information about environment variables, see [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) and the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

Remarks
-------

The **!envvar** extension works both in user mode and in kernel mode. However, in kernel mode, when you set the idle thread as the current process, the pointer to the Process Environment Block (PEB) is **NULL**, so it fails. In kernel mode, the **!envvar** extension displays the environment variables on the target computer, as the following example shows.

```
0:000> !envvar _nt_symbol_path
        _nt_symbol_path = srv*C:\mysyms*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

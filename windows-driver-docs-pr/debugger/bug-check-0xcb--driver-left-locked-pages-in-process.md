# Bug Check 0xCB: DRIVER\_LEFT\_LOCKED\_PAGES\_IN\_PROCESS


The DRIVER\_LEFT\_LOCKED\_PAGES\_IN\_PROCESS bug check has a value of 0x000000CB. This indicates that a driver or the I/O manager failed to release locked pages after an I/O operation.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

## DRIVER\_LEFT\_LOCKED\_PAGES\_IN\_PROCESS Parameters


The four parameters listed in the message can have two possible meanings.

If a driver locked these pages, the parameters have the following meaning.

<table>

If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

Remarks
-------

This bug check is issued only if the registry value **\\\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\\TrackLockedPages** is equal to DWORD 1. If this value is not set, the system will issue the less-informative [**bug check 0x76**](bug-check-0x76--process-has-locked-pages.md) (PROCESS\_HAS\_LOCKED\_PAGES).

Starting with Windows Vista, this bug check can also be issued by Driver Verifier when the Pool Tracking option is enabled.

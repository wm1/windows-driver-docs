# Edit | Display Selected Type


## <span id="ddk_edit_display_selected_type_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_EDIT_DISPLAY_SELECTED_TYPE_DBG"></span>


Click **Display Selected Type** on the **Edit** menu to determine the data type of the current selection in the [Source window](source-window.md) and to display the type in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md).

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+SHIFT+Y or clicking **Display selected type** on the Source window's shortcut menu.

If the selected text includes more than a single object, a syntax error or other irregular results might be displayed. If no text is selected in a Source window, you cannot use this command.

For more information about exceptions, see [Controlling Exceptions and Events](controlling-exceptions-and-events.md), the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation, the Windows SDK documentation, and *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. (These resources may not be available in some languages and countries.) Use the [**.exr**](-exr--display-exception-record-.md) command to display other exception records.

Remarks
-------

The **!cppexr** extension displays information that is related to a C++ exception that the target encounters, including the exception code, the address of the exception, and the exception flags. This exception must be one of the standard C++ exceptions that are defined in Msvcrt.dll.

You can typically obtain the *Address* parameter by using the [**!analyze -v**](-analyze.md) command.

The **!cppexr** extension is useful for determining the type of a C++ exception.

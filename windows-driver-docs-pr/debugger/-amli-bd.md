Remarks
-------

A disabled breakpoint can be re-enabled by using the [**!amli be**](-amli-be.md) extension.

To determine the breakpoint number of a breakpoint, use the [**!amli bl**](-amli-bl.md) extension.

Here is an example of this command:

```
kd> !amli bl
 0:  c29accf5 [\_WAK]
 1:  c29c20a5 [\_SB.PCI0.ISA.BAT1._BST]

kd> !amli bd 1
```

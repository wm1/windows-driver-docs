# Bug Check 0xC7: TIMER\_OR\_DPC\_INVALID


The TIMER\_OR\_DPC\_INVALID bug check has a value of 0x000000C7. This is issued if a kernel timer or delayed procedure call (DPC) is found somewhere in memory where it is not permitted.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

Cause
-----

This condition is usually caused by a driver failing to cancel a timer or DPC before freeing the memory where it resides.

Resolution
----------

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

If you are a system administrator, you should unload the driver if the problem persists.

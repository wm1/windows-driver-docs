# !findthreads


The !findthreads extension displays summary information about one or more threads on the target system based on supplied search criteria. Thread information will be displayed when the associated stack(s) reference the supplied object. This command can be used only during kernel-mode debugging.

Syntax

```
!findthreads [-v][-t  <Thread Address>|-i <IRP Address>|-d <Device Address>|( -a <Pointer Address> -e <End Address> | -l <Range Length>)] 
```

## <span id="ddk__thread_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__THREAD_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______-v______"></span><span id="_______-V______"></span> **-v**   
Displays verbose information on all criteria matches.

<span id="_______-t_Thread_Address______"></span><span id="_______-t_thread_address______"></span><span id="_______-T_THREAD_ADDRESS______"></span> **-t** **** *Thread Address*   
The search criteria will be all modules, wait objects, and IRPs for the thread, as well as device objects and modules generated from the attached IRPs. This option will generally provide the broadest search criteria.

<span id="_______-i_IRP_Address____________"></span><span id="_______-i_irp_address____________"></span><span id="_______-I_IRP_ADDRESS____________"></span> **-i** **** *IRP Address*   
The search criteria will be all modules and devices for the indicated IRP, as well as any reference to the IRP itself.

<span id="_______-d_Device_Address____________"></span><span id="_______-d_device_address____________"></span><span id="_______-D_DEVICE_ADDRESS____________"></span> **-d** **** *Device Address*   
The search criteria will be based from the device object. This will include the module associated with the device object (through the driver object), the device extension, any IRP attached to the device, and similar information for any attached to the device object.

<span id="_______-a_Pointer_Address____________"></span><span id="_______-a_pointer_address____________"></span><span id="_______-A_POINTER_ADDRESS____________"></span> **-a** **** *Pointer Address*   
Add a base address to the criteria. If -e or -l is correctly specified, this value will be the base of a memory range. Otherwise it is interpreted as a pointer.

<span id="_______-e_End_Address____________"></span><span id="_______-e_end_address____________"></span><span id="_______-E_END_ADDRESS____________"></span> **-e** **** *End Address*   
Specifies the end address of the memory range specified with -a.

<span id="_______-l_Range_Length______"></span><span id="_______-l_range_length______"></span><span id="_______-L_RANGE_LENGTH______"></span> **-l** **** *Range Length*   
Specifies the length of the memory range specified with -a.

Here is example output using the -v and -t options:

# Configuring Exceptions and Events in KD


You can configure KD to react to specified exceptions and events in a specific way. For each exception, you can set the break status and the handling status. For each event, you can set the break status.

You can configure the break status or the handling status by using the [**SXE**](sx--sxd--sxe--sxi--sxn--sxr--sx---set-exceptions-.md), **SXD**, **SXN**, or **SXI** command.

For a detailed discussion of exceptions and events, see [Controlling Exceptions and Events](controlling-exceptions-and-events.md).

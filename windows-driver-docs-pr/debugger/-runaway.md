For information about threads in user mode, see [Controlling Processes and Threads](controlling-processes-and-threads.md). For more information about analyzing processes and threads, see *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. (This book may not be available in some languages and countries.)

Remarks
-------

This extension is a quick way to find out which threads are spinning out of control or consuming too much CPU time.

The display identifies each thread by the debugger's internal thread numbering and by the thread ID in hexadecimal. The debugger IDs are also shown.

Here is an example:

```
0:001> !runaway 7

 User Mode Time
 Thread       Time
 0:55c        0:00:00.0093
 1:1a4        0:00:00.0000

 Kernel Mode Time
 Thread       Time
 0:55c        0:00:00.0140
 1:1a4        0:00:00.0000

 Elapsed Time
 Thread       Time
 0:55c        0:00:43.0533
 1:1a4        0:00:25.0876
```

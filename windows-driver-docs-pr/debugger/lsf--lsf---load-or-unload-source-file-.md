Remarks
-------

The **lsf** command loads a source file.

The **lsf-** command unloads a source file. You can use this command to unload files that you previously loaded with **lsf** or automatically loaded source files. You cannot use **lsf-** to unload files that were loaded through WinDbg's [File | Open Source File](file---open-source-file.md) command or files that a WinDbg workspace loaded.

In CDB or KD, you can view source files in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md). In WinDbg, source files are loaded as new [Source windows](source-window.md).

For more information about source files, source paths, and other ways to load source files, see [Source Path](source-path.md).

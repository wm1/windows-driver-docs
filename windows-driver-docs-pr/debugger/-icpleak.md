Remarks
-------

This extension is useful when there is a leak in the I/O completion pool. I/O completion pool leaks can occur when a process is allocating I/O completion packets by calling [**PostQueuedCompletionStatus**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365458), but is not calling [**GetQueuedCompletionStatus**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa364986) to free them, or when a process is queuing completion entries to a port, but there is no thread retrieving the entries. To detect a leak run the [**!poolused**](-poolused.md) extension and check the value of ICP pool tag. If pool use with the ICP tag is significant, a leak might have occurred.

This extension works only if the system maintains type lists. If the *HandleFlag* is set and the system has many processes, this extension will take a long time to run.

You can stop at any point by pressing CTRL+BREAK (in WinDbg) or CTRL+C (in KD).

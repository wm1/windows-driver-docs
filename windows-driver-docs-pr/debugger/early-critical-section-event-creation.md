# Early critical section event creation

The **Early critical section event creation** flag creates event handles when a critical section is initialized, rather than waiting until the event is needed.

When Windows cannot create an event, it generates the exception during initialization and the calls to enter and leave the critical section do not fail.

Because this flag uses a significant amount of nonpaged pool memory, use it only on very reliable systems that have sufficient memory.

# q, qq (Quit)


The **q** and **qq** commands end the debugging session. (In CDB and KD, this command also exits the debugger itself. In WinDbg, this command returns the debugger to dormant mode.)

```
q 
qq 
```

Remarks
-------

In user-mode debugging, the **q** command ends the debugging session and closes the target application.

In kernel-mode debugging, the **q** command saves the log file and ends the debugging session. The target computer remains locked.

If this command does not work in KD, press [**CTRL+R+ENTER**](ctrl-r--re-synchronize-.md) on the debugger keyboard, and then retry the **q** command. If this action does not work, you must use CTRL+B+ENTER to exit the debugger.

The **qq** command behaves exactly like the **q** command, unless you are performing remote debugging. During remote debugging, the **q** command has no effect, but the **qq** command ends the debugging server. For more information about this effect, see [Remote Debugging Through the Debugger](remote-debugging-through-the-debugger.md).

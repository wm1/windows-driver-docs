# Edit | Set Current Instruction

Click **Set Current Instruction** on the **Edit** menu to change the value of the instruction pointer to the instruction that corresponds to the current line in the active [Source window](source-window.md).

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+SHIFT+I or clicking **Set instruction pointer to current line** on the Source window's shortcut menu.

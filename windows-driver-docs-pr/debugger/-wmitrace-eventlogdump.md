Remarks
-------

This extension is similar to the [**!wmitrace.logdump**](-wmitrace-logdump.md) extension, except that the output of **!wmitrace.eventlogdump** is formatted in event log style, and the output of **!wmitrace.logdump** is formatted in Windows software trace preprocessor (WPP) style. You should choose the extension whose format is appropriate for the data you wish to display.

To find the logger ID of a trace session, use the [**!wmitrace.strdump**](-wmitrace-strdump.md) extension. Alternatively, you can use the Tracelog command tracelog -l to list the trace sessions and their basic properties, including the logger ID.

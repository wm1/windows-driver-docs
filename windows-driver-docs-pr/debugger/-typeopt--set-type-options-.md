<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*

Displays integers in all Watch windows and the Locals window in the default radix.

<span id="0x8"></span><span id="0X8"></span>**0x8**

The size of a symbol is defined as follows: if the symbol is the name of a function, its size is the size of the function in memory. Otherwise, the size of the symbol is the size of the data type that it represents.

<span id="_______FlagName______"></span><span id="_______flagname______"></span><span id="_______FLAGNAME______"></span> *FlagName*

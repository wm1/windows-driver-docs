# Symbol Status Abbreviations


## <span id="ddk_symbol_status_abbreviations_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_SYMBOL_STATUS_ABBREVIATIONS_DBG"></span>


Symbol file types and their loading status can be determined by using the [**lm (List Loaded Modules)**](lm--list-loaded-modules-.md) command, the [**!lmi**](-lmi.md) extension, or WinDbg's [Debug | Modules](debug---modules.md) menu command.

Each of these displays information about loaded modules and their symbols.

The following abbreviations are used in the displays generated by these commands:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Abbreviation</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>deferred</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The module has been loaded, but the debugger has not attempted to load the symbols. Symbols will be loaded when needed. See [Deferred Symbol Loading](deferred-symbol-loading.md) for details.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>#</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>There is a mismatch between the symbol file and the executable, either in their timestamps or in their checksums.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>T</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The timestamp is missing, not accessible, or equal to zero.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>C</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The checksum is missing, not accessible, or equal to zero.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>DIA</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Symbol files were loaded through Debug Interface Access (DIA).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Export</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>No actual symbol files were found, so symbol information was extracted from the binary file's export table.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>M</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>There is a mismatch between the symbol file and the executable, either in their timestamps or in their checksums. However, symbol files have been loaded anyway due to the symbol option settings.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>PERF</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This binary contains [performance-optimized code](debugging-performance-optimized-code.md). Standard address arithmetic may not produce correct results.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Stripped</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Debug information was stripped from the image file.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>PDB</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The symbols are in .pdb format.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>COFF</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The symbols are in common object file format (COFF) symbol format.</p></td>
</tr>

Remarks
-------

This extension is designed for performance logs and events, which cannot be formatted for human-readable display. To display the trace messages in a trace session buffer, along with header data, use [**!wmitrace.logdump**](-wmitrace-logdump.md).

To find the logger ID of a trace session, use the [**!wmitrace.strdump**](-wmitrace-strdump.md) extension. Alternatively, you can use the Tracelog command tracelog -l to list the trace sessions and their basic properties, including the logger ID.

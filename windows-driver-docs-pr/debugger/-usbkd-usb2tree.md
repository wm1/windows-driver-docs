This screen shot shows and example of the output of the **!usb2tree** command.

![output of the !usbkd.usb2tree command showing uhci ehci information and an enumerated hub list](images/usb2tree01.png)

The output shows one EHCI execution unit and two UHCI execution units. The execution units shown in this example happen to be on a single USB host controller device. The output also shows the root hubs and connected devices.

The output uses [Using Debugger Markup Language (DML)](debugger-markup-language-commands.md) to provide links. The links execute commands that give detailed information related to objects in the tree. For example, you could click one of the [**!devobj**](-devobj.md) links to get information about the functional device object associated with the EHCI execution unit. As an alternative to clicking the link, you could enter the command manually: **!devobj ffffe00001ca7050**

**Note**  The DML feature is available in WinDbg, but not in Visual Studio or KD.

-   usbehci.sys (miniport driver for USB 2 host controller)
-   usbuhci.sys (miniport driver for USB 2 host controller)
-   usbport.sys (port driver for USB 2 host controller)

<span id="bug_check"></span><span id="BUG_CHECK"></span>**bug check**  
When Windows encounters hardware problems, inconsistencies within data necessary for its operation, or other severe errors, it shuts down and displays error information on a blue character-mode screen.

This shutdown is known variously as a bug check, kernel error, system crash, stop error, or, occasionally, trap. The screen display itself is referred to as a blue screen or stop screen. The most important information shown on the screen is a message code which gives information about the crash; this is known as a bug check code or stop code.

WinDbg or KD can configure the system so that a debugger is automatically contacted when such an error occurs. Alternatively, the system can be instructed to automatically reboot in case of such an error.

For more information, see [Bug Checks (Blue Screens)](bug-checks--blue-screens-.md).

<span id="bug_check_code"></span><span id="BUG_CHECK_CODE"></span>**bug check code**  
The hexadecimal code indicating a specific type of bug check .

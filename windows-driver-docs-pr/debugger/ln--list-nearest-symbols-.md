<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the address where the debugger should start to search for symbols. The nearest symbols, either before or after *Address*, are displayed. For more information about the syntax, see [Address and Address Range Syntax](address-and-address-range-syntax.md).

<span id="_D"></span><span id="_d"></span>**/D**  
Specifies that the output is displayed using [Debugger Markup Language (DML)](debugger-markup-language-commands.md). The DML output includes a link that you can use to explore the module that contains the nearest symbol. It also includes a link that you can use to set a breakpoint.

Remarks
-------

You can use the **ln** command to help determine what a pointer is pointing to. This command can also be useful when you are looking at a corrupted stack to determine which procedure made a call.

If source line information is available, the **ln** display also includes the source file name and line number information.

If you are using a [source server](using-a-source-server.md), the **ln** command displays information that is related to the source server.

# Bug Check 0xA: IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL


The IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at an invalid address while at a raised interrupt request level (IRQL). This is typically either a bad pointer or a pageability problem.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

Cause
-----

Bug check 0xA is usually caused by kernel mode device drivers using improper addresses.

This bug check indicates that an attempt was made to access an invalid address while at a raised interrupt request level (IRQL). This is either a bad memory pointer or a pageability problem with the device driver code.

1. If parameter 1 is less than 0x1000, then this is likely a NULL pointer dereference.
2. If !pool reports that parameter 1 is Paged pool, then the IRQL is too high to access this data. Run at a lower IRQL or allocate the data in NonPagedPool.
3. If parameter 3 indicates that this was an attempt to execute pageable code, then the IRQL is too high to call this function. Run at a lower IRQL or do not mark the code as pageable.
4. Otherwise, this may be a bad pointer, possibly caused by use-after-free or bit-flipping. Investigate the validity of parameter 1 with [**!pte**](-pte.md), [**!address**](-address.md), and [**ln (List Nearest Symbols)**](ln--list-nearest-symbols-.md).

Resolution
----------

If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.

**Gather Information**

Examine the name of the driver if that was listed on the blue screen.

Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. For more information, see [Open Event Viewer](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows/what-information-event-logs-event-viewer#1TC=windows-7). Look for critical errors in the system log that occurred in the same time window as the blue screen.

**Driver Verifier**

Driver Verifier is a tool that runs in real time to examine the behavior of drivers. For example, Driver Verifier checks the use of memory resources, such as memory pools. If it sees errors in the execution of driver code, it proactively creates an exception to allow that part of the driver code to be further scrutinized. The driver verifier manager is built into Windows and is available on all Windows PCs. To start the driver verifier manager, type *Verifer* at a command prompt. You can configure which drivers you would like to verify. The code that verifies drivers adds overhead as it runs, so try and verify the smallest number of drivers as possible. For more information, see [Driver Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545448).

Remarks
-------

The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.

If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.

**Resolving a faulty hardware problem:** If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.

**Resolving a faulty system service problem:** Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system startup, investigate the Windows repair options. For more information, see [Recovery options in Windows 10](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options).

**Resolving an antivirus software problem:** Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.

For general blue screen troubleshooting information, see [**Blue Screen Data**](blue-screen-data.md).

# !hstring


The **!hstring** extension displays the fields of an **HSTRING**. The last item in the display is the string itself.

```
!hstring Address
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="Address"></span><span id="address"></span><span id="ADDRESS"></span>*Address*  
The address of an **HSTRING**.

Remarks
-------

The **HSTRING** data type supports strings that have embedded NULL characters. However, the **!hstring** extension displays the string only up to the first NULL character. To see the entire string including the embedded NULL characters, use the [**!hstring2**](-hstring2.md) extension.

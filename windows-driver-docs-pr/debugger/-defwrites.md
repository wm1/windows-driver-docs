The **!defwrites** extension displays the values of the kernel variables used by the cache manager.

```
!defwrites

For information about write throttling, see *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. (This book may not be available in some languages and countries.)

For information about other cache management extensions, use the [**!cchelp**](-cchelp.md) extension.

Remarks
-------

When the number of deferred writes ("dirty pages") becomes too large, page writing will be throttled. This extension allows you to see whether your system has reached this point.

Here is an example:

```
kd> !defwrites 
*** Cache Write Throttle Analysis ***

        CcTotalDirtyPages:                   0 (       0 Kb)
        CcDirtyPageThreshold:             1538 (    6152 Kb)
        MmAvailablePages:                 2598 (   10392 Kb)
        MmThrottleTop:                     250 (    1000 Kb)
        MmThrottleBottom:                   30 (     120 Kb)
        MmModifiedPageListHead.Total:      699 (    2796 Kb)

Write throttles not engaged
```

In this case, there are no dirty pages. If **CcTotalDirtyPages** reaches 1538 (the value of **CcDirtyPageThreshold**), writing will be delayed until the number of dirty pages is reduced.

# !locks (!ntsdexts.locks)


The **!locks** extension in Ntsdexts.dll displays a list of critical sections associated with the current process.

This extension command should not be confused with the [**!kdext\*.locks**](-locks---kdext--locks-.md) extension command.

```
    !locks [Options] 
```

For other commands and extensions that can display critical section information, see [Displaying a Critical Section](displaying-a-critical-section.md). For information about critical sections, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation, the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation, and *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon.

Remarks
-------

This extension command shows all critical sections that have been initialized by calling **RtlInitializeCriticalSection**. If there are no critical sections, then no output will result.

Here is an example:

```
0:000> !locks

CritSec w3svc!g_pWamDictator+a0 at 68C2C298
LockCount          0
RecursionCount     1
OwningThread       d1
EntryCount         1
ContentionCount    0
*** Locked

CritSec SMTPSVC+66a30 at 67906A30
LockCount          0
RecursionCount     1
OwningThread       d0
EntryCount         1

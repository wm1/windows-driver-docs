# Closing a Window


## <span id="ddk_closing_a_window_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CLOSING_A_WINDOW_DBG"></span>


To close a debugging information window, click the **Close** button in the upper-right corner of the window.

If you want to close the active window, you can also click **Close Current Window** on the **File** menu or press CTRL+F4.

You can close one of the debugging information windows by pressing ALT+SHIFT+*number*, where ALT+*number* are the shortcut keys that open this window. (For a list of the possible shortcut keys, see [Opening a Window](opening-a-window.md).)

To close all [Source windows](source-window.md) at the same time, click [Close All Source Windows](window---close-all-source-windows.md) on the **Window** menu. This command will not close a Source window that has been designated as a tab-dock target. For more information on this setting, see the Source Window topic.

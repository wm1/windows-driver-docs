Remarks
-------

This command only works in user mode. In kernel mode you should use [**!thread**](-thread.md) instead. This command works with user-mode minidumps as long as they were created with the **/mt** or **/ma** options; see [Minidumps](minidumps.md) for details.

The **.ttime** command shows the creation time of the thread, as well as the amount of time it has been running in kernel mode and in user mode.

Here is an example:

```
0:000> .ttime
Created: Sat Jun 28 17:58:42 2003
Kernel:  0 days 0:00:00.131
User:    0 days 0:00:02.109
```

# Bug Check 0x1A: MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT


The MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT bug check has a value of 0x0000001A. This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred.

**Important** This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors).

## MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT Parameters


Parameter 1 is the only parameter of interest; this identifies the exact violation.

For more information about the suspend count and how suspended threads behave and for a list of other commands that control the suspending and freezing of threads, see [Controlling Processes and Threads](controlling-processes-and-threads.md).

Remarks
-------

You can specify threads only in user mode. In kernel mode, the tilde (~) refers to a processor.

Every time that you use the **~n** command, the thread's suspend count is increased by one.

The thread's start address is displayed when you use this command.

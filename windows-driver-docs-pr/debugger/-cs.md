# !cs


The **!cs** extension displays one or more critical sections or the whole critical section tree.

```
!cs [-s] [-l] [-o] 
!cs [-s] [-o] Address 
!cs [-s] [-l] [-o] StartAddress EndAddress 
!cs [-s] [-o] -d InfoAddress

<span id="_______-s______"></span><span id="_______-S______"></span> **-s**   
Displays each critical section's initialization stack trace, if this information is available.

<span id="_______-l______"></span><span id="_______-L______"></span> **-l**   
Display only the locked critical sections.

<span id="_______-o______"></span><span id="_______-O______"></span> **-o**   
Displays the owner's stack for any locked critical section that is being displayed.

<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the address of the critical section to display. If you omit this parameter, the debugger displays all critical sections in the current process.

<span id="_______StartAddress______"></span><span id="_______startaddress______"></span><span id="_______STARTADDRESS______"></span> *StartAddress*   
Specifies the beginning of the address range to search for critical sections.

<span id="_______EndAddress______"></span><span id="_______endaddress______"></span><span id="_______ENDADDRESS______"></span> *EndAddress*   
Specifies the end of the address range to search for critical sections.

<span id="_______-d______"></span><span id="_______-D______"></span> **-d**   
Displays critical sections that are associated with DebugInfo.

<span id="_______InfoAddress______"></span><span id="_______infoaddress______"></span><span id="_______INFOADDRESS______"></span> *InfoAddress*   
Specifies the address of the DebugInfo.

<span id="_______-t______"></span><span id="_______-T______"></span> **-t**   
Displays a critical section tree. Before you can use the **-t** option, you must activate [Application Verifier](application-verifier.md) for the target process and select the **Check lock usage** option.

<span id="_______TreeAddress______"></span><span id="_______treeaddress______"></span><span id="_______TREEADDRESS______"></span> *TreeAddress*   
Specifies the address of the root of the critical section tree. If you omit this parameter or specify zero, the debugger displays the critical section tree for the current process.

<span id="_______-_______"></span> **-?**   
Displays some Help text for this extension in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md).

For other commands and extensions that can display critical section information, see [Displaying a Critical Section](displaying-a-critical-section.md). For more information about critical sections, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation, the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation, and *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. (These resources may not be available in some languages and countries.)

Remarks
-------

The **!cs** extension requires full symbols (including type information) for the process that is being debugged and for Ntdll.dll. If you do not have symbols for Ntdll.dll, see [Installing Windows Symbol Files](installing-windows-symbol-files.md).

The following examples shows you how to use **!cs**. The following command displays information about the critical section at address 0x7803B0F8 and shows its initialization stack trace.

```
0:001> !cs -s 0x7803B0F8
Critical section   = 0x7803B0F8 (MSVCRT!__app_type+0x4)
DebugInfo          = 0x6A262080
NOT LOCKED
LockSemaphore      = 0x0
SpinCount          = 0x0

Stack trace for DebugInfo = 0x6A262080:

0x6A2137BD: ntdll!RtlInitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount+0x9B
0x6A207A4C: ntdll!LdrpCallInitRoutine+0x14
0x6A205569: ntdll!LdrpRunInitializeRoutines+0x1D9
0x6A20DCE1: ntdll!LdrpInitializeProcess+0xAE5
```

The following command displays information about the critical section whose DebugInfo is at address 0x6A262080.

```
0:001> !cs -d 0x6A262080
DebugInfo          = 0x6A262080
Critical section   = 0x7803B0F8 (MSVCRT!__app_type+0x4)
NOT LOCKED
LockSemaphore      = 0x0
SpinCount          = 0x0
```

The following command displays information about all of the active critical sections in the current process.

```
## 0:001> !cs

DebugInfo          = 0x6A261D60
Critical section   = 0x6A262820 (ntdll!RtlCriticalSectionLock+0x0)
LOCKED
LockCount          = 0x0
OwningThread       = 0x460
RecursionCount     = 0x1
LockSemaphore      = 0x0
## SpinCount          = 0x0

DebugInfo          = 0x6A261D80
Critical section   = 0x6A262580 (ntdll!DeferedCriticalSection+0x0)
NOT LOCKED
LockSemaphore      = 0x7FC
## SpinCount          = 0x0

DebugInfo          = 0x6A262600
Critical section   = 0x6A26074C (ntdll!LoaderLock+0x0)
NOT LOCKED
LockSemaphore      = 0x0
## SpinCount          = 0x0

DebugInfo          = 0x77fbde20
Critical section   = 0x77c8ba60 (GDI32!semColorSpaceCache+0x0)
LOCKED
LockCount          = 0x0
OwningThread       = 0x00000dd8
RecursionCount     = 0x1
LockSemaphore      = 0x0
## SpinCount          = 0x00000000

The following command displays the critical section tree.

The following items appear in this **!cs -t** display:

-   **InitThr** is the thread ID for the thread that initialized the CS.

-   **EnterThr** is the ID of the thread that called **EnterCriticalSection** last time.

-   **WaitThr** is the ID of the thread that found the critical section that another thread owned and waited for it last time.

-   **TryEnThr** is the ID of the thread that called **TryEnterCriticalSection** last time.

-   **LeaveThr** is the ID of the thread that called **LeaveCriticalSection** last time

-   **EnterCnt** is the count of **EnterCriticalSection**.

-   **WaitCnt** is the contention count.

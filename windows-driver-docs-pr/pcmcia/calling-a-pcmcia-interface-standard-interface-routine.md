# Calling a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface Routine


## <a href="" id="ddk-calling-a-pcmcia-interface-standard-interface-routine-kg"></a>


This section describes how to call a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface routine.

After a driver obtains an [PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface Memory Card Routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537607) structure from the PCMCIA bus driver, the driver can call the interface routines.

Each interface routine requires a context pointer. The driver must use the **Context** member value returned by the PCMCIA bus driver in the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD structure. If the context pointer is not valid, the system behavior is not defined, and the system might halt.

The PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface routines can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL. To maintain overall system performance, it is strongly recommended that a driver call these routines at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH\_LEVEL. Calling an interface routine at IRQL DISPATCH\_LEVEL can cause the caller to block system operation for a significant period of time.

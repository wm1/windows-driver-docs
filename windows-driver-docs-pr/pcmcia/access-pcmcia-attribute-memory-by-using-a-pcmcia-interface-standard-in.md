# Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory by Using a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface


## <a href="" id="ddk-access-pcmcia-attribute-memory-by-using-a-pcmcia-interface-standar"></a>


This section describes how a driver can use a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface to access attribute memory.

The PCMCIA interface standard is provided primarily for memory card drivers and file systems.

A driver can use the [**PCMCIA\_MODIFY\_MEMORY\_WINDOW**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537610) interface routine supported by the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface. PCMCIA\_MODIFY\_MEMORY\_WINDOW sets the attributes of a memory window for a PCMCIA memory card. The memory window is mapped by the PCMCIA bus driver. Note that this routine does not provide a permanent window, it only modifies the current settings for an existing window. In addition, settings are not persistent over a change in the system power state.

For more information, see [PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface for Memory Cards](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537606).

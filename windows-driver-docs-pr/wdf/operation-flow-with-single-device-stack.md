# Operation Flow with Single Device Stack


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

The following figure shows the flow of operations that occur to and from the UMDF functional driver in a single device stack.

![umdf call sequence for create file followed by a read request](images/umdfflow.gif)

**Note**   All I/O that is initiated by applications is routed through kernel mode as shown in the figures in the [Architecture of the UMDF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554461) section, even though the preceding figure does not show this situation.

 

The UMDF driver calls the [**IWDFIoRequest::GetCreateParameters**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559088) method only if it requires information about the file that is associated with the read request. The UMDF driver calls the [**IWDFIoRequest::GetReadParameters**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559113) method only if it requires more information about the read request.

The UMDF driver can call the [**IWDFIoRequest::Complete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559070) method rather than the [**IWDFIoRequest::CompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559074) method if specifying the number of bytes that are transferred in the read operation is not required. The UMDF driver calls **Complete** or **CompleteWithInformation** to signal that the read operation is complete; the application can then access the read data.

# Adding a Device


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

The framework adds a device object for each device loaded in the driver host process. To add the device, the framework calls the driver's [**IDriverEntry::OnDeviceAdd**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554896) method and passes the [IWDFDriver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558893) and [IWDFDeviceInitialize](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556965) interfaces in the call. The supplied **IWDFDeviceInitialize** interface is only valid before the driver calls [**IWDFDriver::CreateDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899). The driver can call the following methods of **IWDFDeviceInitialize** to perform the following operations:

-   The driver calls the [**IWDFDeviceInitialize::RetrieveDevicePropertyStore**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556982) method to retrieve the [IWDFNamedPropertyStore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560164) interface for the device property store. The driver can use **IWDFNamedPropertyStore** to retrieve and set properties for the device.

-   The driver calls the [**IWDFDeviceInitialize::SetLockingConstraint**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556991) method to specify how its callback functions are called by the framework.

-   The driver calls the [**IWDFDeviceInitialize::SetFilter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556985) method to enable the device as a filter device.

After the driver uses [IWDFDeviceInitialize](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556965) to initialize the device, the driver passes a pointer to **IWDFDeviceInitialize** in a call to the [**IWDFDriver::CreateDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899) method to create a [UMDF device object](framework-device-object.md) for the device. After the framework device object is created, the driver makes calls to the [**IWDFDevice::CreateIoQueue**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557020) method to create read and write I/O queues. In these **IWDFDevice::CreateIoQueue** calls, the driver must identify how it receives requests from the I/O queue. For more information, see [Configuring Dispatch Mode for an I/O Queue](configuring-dispatch-mode-for-an-i-o-queue.md).

# UMDF Objects and Interfaces


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

The User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) is composed of a set of cooperating objects. The UMDF creates and manages a series of objects exposed to the user-mode device driver. Some of theses objects are created by the UMDF in response to application-triggered actions, such as an I/O request, while other UMDF objects are created when the driver calls UMDF interface methods. For example, to create an I/O queue object, the driver calls the [**IWDFDevice::CreateIoQueue**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557020) method.

The following topics describe the core framework objects, the subset of the Component Object Model (COM) on which they are based, and the UMDF DDI programming model:

-   [Framework Objects](framework-objects.md)
-   [Framework Object Hierarchy](framework-object-hierarchy.md)
-   [UMDF Based on COM Subset](umdf-based-on-com-subset.md)
-   [UMDF DDI Programming Model](umdf-ddi-programming-model.md)
-   [Managing the Lifetime of Objects](managing-the-lifetime-of-objects.md)

# PnP and Power Management Scenarios in UMDF


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

The following PnP and power management scenarios show the sequences in which the framework calls a UMDF driver's event callback functions:

-   [A User Plugs in a Device](a-user-plugs-in-a-device-umdf.md)
-   [A User Unplugs a Device](a-user-unplugs-a-device-umdf.md)
-   [A Device Enters a Low-Power State](a-device-enters-a-low-power-state-umdf.md)
-   [A Device Returns to Its Working State](a-device-returns-to-its-working-state-umdf.md)
-   [The PnP Manager Redistributes System Resources](the-pnp-manager-redistributes-system-resources-umdf.md)

For information about PnP and power management callback sequences for KMDF drivers, see [PnP and Power Management Callback Sequences](pnp-and-power-management-callback-sequences.md).

# A Device Enters a Low-Power State


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

A device leaves its working (D0) state and enters a low-power state if one of the following occurs:

-   The device is idle (that is, not being accessed) and is capable of entering a low-power idle state while the system remains in its working (S0) state.

-   The system's power state has changed from its working (S0) state to a low-power state. (Drivers can call [**IWDFDevice2::GetSystemPowerAction**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556936) to determine the reason for the change in the system's power state.)

For each UMDF-based function and filter driver that supports the device, the framework does the following, in sequence, one driver at a time, starting with the driver that is highest in the driver stack:

1.  If the driver is using self-managed I/O, the framework calls the driver's [**IPnpCallbackSelfManagedIo::OnSelfManagedIoSuspend**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556790) callback function.

2.  The framework stops all of the device's power-managed I/O queues and calls their [**IPnpCallbackSelfManagedIo::OnSelfManagedIoStop**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556787) callback functions (if they exist).

3.  If the driver is the device's power policy owner, the framework calls its [**IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0::OnArmWakeFromS0**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556817) or [**IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx::OnArmWakeFromSx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556826) callback function.

4.  The framework calls the driver's [**IPnpCallback::OnD0Exit**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556803) callback function (if it exists).

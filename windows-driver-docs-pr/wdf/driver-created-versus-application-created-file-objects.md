# Driver-Created Versus Application-Created File Objects


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

When an application opens a handle to a device, the framework calls your driver's [**IQueueCallbackCreate::OnCreateFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556841) method and supplies a pointer to the [**IWDFFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558912) interface for the file object that is associated with the device. Any I/O requests that the application sends to the opened handle are associated with the created file object. When such requests arrive, the framework calls the appropriate method from one of the driver-supplied [UMDF Queue Object Interfaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561301). The driver can then call [**IWDFIoRequest::GetFileObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559099) to determine the file object associated with the request. The driver can call [**AssignContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560208) on the file object to associate context that is is specific to the I/O session.

The following table shows calls the application makes and the resulting notifications that the driver receives.

A system component may issue a create request on behalf of a Universal Windows app. If the driver needs to determine the process ID of the app that issued the create request, it can call the [**IWDFFile3::GetInitiatorProcessId**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451279) method.

## Driver-created file objects


If your driver needs to create and send an I/O request independent of the application to the next driver in the stack (the default I/O target), the driver must call [**IWDFDevice::CreateWdfFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558828) to retrieve a pointer to a [**IWDFDriverCreatedFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558895) interface. In this case, the next driver receives the same notifications that your driver receives when the application generates the request.

The following table shows calls your driver makes and the resulting notifications to the next driver in the stack.

For the next device in the stack, no difference exists between the file object that is created by an application and the file object that is created by a higher-layer device.

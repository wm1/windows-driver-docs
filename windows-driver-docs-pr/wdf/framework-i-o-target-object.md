# Framework I/O Target Object


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

The framework I/O target object is exposed to drivers by the [IWDFIoTarget](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559170) interface. It retrieves information about an I/O target, which typically represents a lower driver in the stack but can also represent another UMDF driver or the kernel-mode portion of the stack. The I/O target object provides UMDF drivers a way to send requests to another device.

UMDF drivers can also use the [IWDFIoTargetStateManagement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559198) interface to manage and monitor the state of an I/O target object.

# Enabling and Disabling Interrupts


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

If your driver handles device interrupts, it must provide [*OnInterruptEnable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463899) and [*OnInterruptDisable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463895) callback functions that enable and disable the interrupts. These callback functions must do whatever is necessary to enable and disable a device's interrupt mechanism.

If your driver must perform additional operations that are related to enabling or disabling interrupts, the driver can also provide [**IPnpCallbackHardwareInterrupt::OnD0EntryPostInterruptsEnabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439750) and [**IPnpCallbackHardwareInterrupt::OnD0ExitPreInterruptsDisabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439755) callback functions.

The framework calls the driver's [*OnInterruptEnable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463899) and [**IPnpCallbackHardwareInterrupt::OnD0EntryPostInterruptsEnabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439750) callback functions each time the device enters its working (D0) state, after the framework has called the driver's [**OnD0Entry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556799) callback function. The framework calls the driver's [**IPnpCallbackHardwareInterrupt::OnD0ExitPreInterruptsDisabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439755) and [*OnInterruptDisable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463895) callback functions each time the device leaves its working state, before the framework calls the driver's [**OnD0Exit**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556803) callback function. For more information about when the framework calls a driver's callback functions, see [PnP and Power Management in UMDF-based Drivers](pnp-and-power-management-in-umdf-drivers.md).

You must not assume that a device will use the same interrupt resources each time the framework calls your driver's [*OnInterruptEnable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463899) callback function. Sometimes the PnP manager redistributes system resources, and it might assign new interrupt resources to your device.

The driver can call [**IWDFInterrupt::GetInfo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451309) to determine a device's interrupt resources. The driver can call [**IWDFInterrupt::GetDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451305) to determine the device that an interrupt object belongs to.

To enable and disable interrupts directly, the driver can call the interrupt object's [**IWDFInterrupt::Enable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451300) and [**IWDFInterrupt::Disable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451295) methods, which call the driver's [*OnInterruptEnable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463899) and [*OnInterruptDisable*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463895) event callback functions. However, most drivers should just allow the framework to call the *OnInterruptEnable* and *OnInterruptDisable* callback functions at the proper times.

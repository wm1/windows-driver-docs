# Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard


The Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard allows you to submit hardware for certification, and code sign and publish your drivers to Windows Update. You can also now use shipping labels to easily collaborate on driver development with your business partners.

To get started watch our [introductory video series](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828003) to learn more about the new dashboard. See [Get started with the Hardware Program](get-started-with-the-hardware-dashboard.md) for registering and using.

The Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard replaces the [Hardware Dev Center (Sysdev)](dashboard-services.md) for most hardware tasks. The dashboard allows you to create and manage your submissions quickly and easily, with improved experiences for:

-   HCK/HLK device certification submissions
-   Publishing to Windows Update. You can now create shipping labels with promotions (critical and/or dynamic update) directly from the dashboard.
-   Sharing your driver with another company (Resell)
-   Customizing your driver after initial certification (DUA)
-   Managing your users and legal agreements
-   System/Hardware certification submissions

You must continue to use [Hardware Dev Center (Sysdev)](dashboard-services.md) to complete the following tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The dashboard submission REST APIs will no longer be available for use as of November 10th, 2016. APIs for driver submissions are under consideration for a future release.

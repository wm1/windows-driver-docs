# Windows Certified Products List


The [Windows Certified Products List](http://sysdev.microsoft.com/hardware/lpl/) is a comprehensive list of certified devices and systems.

You can find devices and systems by filtering the list or by running a search for a specific product name.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Windows Certified Products List only exists on the legacy dashboard, and does not include submissions made through the Windows Hardware Dev Center Dashboard.

To find a product by searching (in this case, Arc Mouse), follow these steps:

1.  In **Select a group**, select **Device**. This determines what you’ll see in the **Select a product type** and **Select a feature or AQ** lists. If you perform a search for Arc Mouse with **System** selected in this list, no results will be returned.

2.  Type **Arc Mouse** in the **Enter a search value** box, and then click **Search**. A result set of all hardware devices that contain this text string is returned. You can sort this list by **Product name**, **Company**, or **Certifications** by clicking the appropriate heading.

3.  Narrow the scope of the search and reduce the number of records returned by selecting **Windows 8.1 Client** in the **Select an OS** list and then clicking **Search**.

4.  Click the product name to get further details about the product. The list of details includes the product name, company, compatibility status, product type, and certification status.

> [!Note]  
> Search is limited to **Product Name** and **Company**.

> Search will run an AND operation on any word entered in the **Search** box.

> Search treats multiple words enclosed in quotation marks as one search string.

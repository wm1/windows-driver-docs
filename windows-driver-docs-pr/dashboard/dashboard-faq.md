One organization can associate multiple certificates with its Dashboard account. As long as the submission is signed with any one of those certificates, it will be allowed.

This includes both EV and Standard – there is no restriction on the number of certificates bound to your company.

Dashboard does not send a status report for software submission. On the submission page, check **Status &gt; Signed**. If the submission is signed, it is considered Approved and certification is complete.

**Signing Date** indicates **Not yet signed** by default, which is by design. This is not considered for submission status.

### <span id="What__is_the_hardware_certification_submission_processing_time_"></span><span id="what__is_the_hardware_certification_submission_processing_time_"></span><span id="WHAT__IS_THE_HARDWARE_CERTIFICATION_SUBMISSION_PROCESSING_TIME_"></span>What is the hardware certification submission processing time?

All hardware submissions to Dashboard have a 5-business day service level agreement (SLA), but you can generally expect 1-2 business days for completion. If you need help with your submission, you can contact [Sysdev@Microsoft.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624170) with your business justification.

Check that the announcement date that has been set. If it is not, set the date for either the current date or your preferred date. The product will be listed the day after the date you set.

In an effort to make Windows 10 more secure without affecting performance, all binaries now receive embedded signatures. This applies to all the submissions submitted for certification, not only submissions based on Windows 10.

Make sure your final package has a single driver folder on the **Package** tab and the driver’s properties include all the operating systems you have tested.

### <span id="Driver_signing_submission_fails_with_error__There_are_files_at_the_root_of_the_cabinet__or___No_.inf_files_found_in_driver_directory_directories__XYZ_"></span><span id="driver_signing_submission_fails_with_error__there_are_files_at_the_root_of_the_cabinet__or___no_.inf_files_found_in_driver_directory_directories__xyz_"></span><span id="DRIVER_SIGNING_SUBMISSION_FAILS_WITH_ERROR__THERE_ARE_FILES_AT_THE_ROOT_OF_THE_CABINET__OR___NO_.INF_FILES_FOUND_IN_DRIVER_DIRECTORY_DIRECTORIES__XYZ_"></span>Driver signing submission fails with error “There are files at the root of the cabinet” or “\#No .inf files found in driver directory/directories: XYZ”

The failure is because the structure of the .cab file is incorrect. The .cab structure was created with driver files in the root folder of the .cab file instead of having them in a subfolder (driver). Please review the instructions for how to create a proper .cab file for the driver signing submission here:

[Driver Signing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn962252.aspx)

**Note**  Currently, there is a bug when symbol files are included in the driver package and the submission will fail.

### <span id="How_to_get_a_waiver_for_Software_Certification_failures"></span><span id="how_to_get_a_waiver_for_software_certification_failures"></span><span id="HOW_TO_GET_A_WAIVER_FOR_SOFTWARE_CERTIFICATION_FAILURES"></span>How to get a waiver for Software Certification failures

You need to submit the Windows App Certification Kit report to the Dashboard so that the waiver can be reviewed.

Unfortunately, there can be no waiver review without a completed submission. The ‘known’ waiver scenarios would trigger a specific Windows App Certification Kit UI for the partner to provide the details (all those steps and UI are also described in the [Certification white paper](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=624385)).

If this is a not a ‘known’ (that is, supported) waiver scenario, the report can still submitted to Dashboard. Even if the report is failing, it will be reviewed and we will reach out to you for additional information as needed.

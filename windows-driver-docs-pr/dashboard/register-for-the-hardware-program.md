# Register for the Hardware Program


Your company's administrator must [register](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828002) for the Windows Hardware Dev Center program.

## <span id="Before_you_sign_up"></span><span id="before_you_sign_up"></span><span id="BEFORE_YOU_SIGN_UP"></span>Before you sign up


Review the following requirements before you start the registration process.

-   If you have an existing company Dev Center account that you want to use for the Hardware program, sign in with it before you begin registration.

-   You must have an Extended Validation (EV) code signing certificate. Check whether your company already has a code signing certificate. If your company already has a certificate, have the certificate available as you will be asked to sign a file. If your company does not have a certificate, you will need to buy one as part of the registration process.

    For information about code signing certificates and how to get a certificate, see [Get a code signing certificate](get-a-code-signing-certificate.md).

-   You will need to sign in with your organization’s Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [Global administrator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746654) account. If you don’t know whether your organization has an Azure AD directory, contact your IT department. If your organization doesn’t have an Azure AD directory, you must be able to create one.

-   You must have the authority to sign legal agreements on behalf of your organization.

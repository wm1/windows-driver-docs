# Building a Universal Windows driver

You can use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 in conjunction with Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10 to build drivers for desktop, mobile, or universal. You can download kits and tools from the [Windows Hardware Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524487).

In many cases, you can recompile a legacy kernel-mode driver as a Universal Windows driver, as long as the driver does not work with any user-mode components. Legacy WDM and KMDF drivers should recompile as Universal Windows drivers targeting Windows 10 with no conversion required.

In contrast, existing user-mode drivers may require modification to compile as Universal Windows drivers. Specifically, your driver package must not have any dependencies outside of UWP. For example, only some of the Win32 APIs are part of UWP.

## Converting an existing driver project to a Universal Windows driver project

1.  In Visual Studio 2015, open the existing driver project.
2.  In the Solution Explorer pane, right-click the solution and choose **Configuration Manager**. Set the target operating system to Windows 10.
3.  Right-click the driver project and choose **Properties**. Under Configuration Properties-&gt;Driver, verify that **Target Platform** is set to **Universal**. Other choices include **Desktop**, to build a driver that runs on Windows 10 for desktop editions only, and **Mobile**, to build a driver that runs on Windows 10 Mobile only.
4.  Build the driver. You might see linker errors.
5.  Fix the errors one by one by going through the error log. Refer to individual reference pages in the documentation for possible alternate APIs. If replacements are not available, you may need to redesign your driver.

## Creating a New Universal Windows driver Project in Microsoft Visual Studio

1.  Create a new driver from a template (**File&gt;New Project-&gt;Templates-&gt;Visual C++-&gt;Windows Driver-&gt;WDF**) and choose either **User Mode Driver (UMDF V2)** or **Kernel Mode Driver (KMDF)**.
2.  After you create the project, in the Solution Explorer pane, right-click the solution and choose **Configuration Manager**. Set **Active solution configuration** to the desired target Windows version, and set **Active solution platform** to **Win32** or **x64**. If **ARM** is not listed, choose **&lt;New...&gt;** to build for ARM.

    If you choose Windows 10, the driver model defaults to **Universal**.

    To change driver model manually, right-click the driver project and choose Properties. Under **Configuration Properties-&gt;Driver Settings-&gt;General**, find the **Target Platform** entry. Choose **Universal**, **Desktop**, or **Mobile**. Microsoft Visual Studio uses this setting to determine what libraries to link against.

    **Note**  You cannot build a Universal Windows driver for Windows versions earlier than Windows 10.
3.  You might need to modify the .inf file to specify the provider, specified as an %*ManufacturerName*% token that is expanded later in the INF file's [**Strings**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff547485) section. For example:

    ```
    Provider="Contoso"
    ```

4.  You can now build the solution. Visual Studio links against the required libraries and generates a .cat file, an .inf file, and a driver binary.

For information about the configuration settings you can use in Visual Studio when building your driver, see [Building a Driver with the WDK](building-a-driver.md).

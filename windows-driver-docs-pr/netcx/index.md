# Network Adapter WDF Class Extension (Cx)

[!include[NetAdapterCx Beta Prerelease](../netcx-beta-prerelease.md)]

Starting in WindowsÂ 10 Creators Update (version 1703), the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes a class extension module (NetAdapterCx) that enables you to write a KMDF-based driver (called the client driver in this section) for a Network Interface Controller (NIC).  NetAdapterCx gives you the power and flexibility of WDF and the networking performance of NDIS, and makes it easy to write a driver for your NIC.

In previous versions of Windows, WDF and NDIS had individual advantages, but did not interoperate well. The only way to write a NIC driver was to write an NDIS miniport driver. To use WDF in an NDIS miniport driver, you had to write extra code in your driver, and even then, you only had access to a small subset of WDF functionality.

With the NetAdapterCx model, conversely, you write a real WDF driver for your NIC.  This means that your NetAdapterCx driver has access to full WDF functionality, as well as networking-specific APIs and I/O support from the NetAdapter class extension.  As shown in the block diagram below, NetAdapterCx still works behind the scenes with NDIS, but it handles all the interaction with NDIS on your behalf.
